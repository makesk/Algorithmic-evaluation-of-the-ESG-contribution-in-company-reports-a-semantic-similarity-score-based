In addition, the Group adheres to the \\r\\nAnnual Accounts Act for Credit Institutions and Securities Companies and the Financial Supervisory Authority \\r\\nregulations (FFFS 2008:25) and RFR1 Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups. The Parent information has \\r\\nbeen prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554) and with application of the \\r\\nSwedish Financial Reporting Boards RFR 2 Accounting for legal entities. The condensed interim financial \\r\\ninformation do not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and \\r\\nshould be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual financial statements as at 31 December 2017. \\r\\n \\r\\nComparative figures for the Group are the same ones as disclosed for the Parent due to the fact that the merge of \\r\\nNordea and DNB Baltic businesses was done on 1st October 2017. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed interim financial information are consistent \\r\\nwith those followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December \\r\\n2017, except for the estimation of income tax and new accounting standards which came into force from 1 \\r\\nJanuary 2018 and are described below. \\r\\n \\r\\nIncome tax expense is recognised based on management’s estimate of the weighted average effective annual \\r\\nincome tax rate expected for the full financial year.  \\r\\n \\r\\nChanges in accounting policies \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 9 as issued by the IASB in July 2014 with a date of adoption of January 2018, \\r\\nwhich resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the \\r\\nfinancial statements. The Group did not early adopt any of IFRS 9 in previous periods. \\r\\n \\r\\nAs permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group elected not to restate comparative figures. Any \\r\\nadjustement to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in \\r\\nthe opening retained earnings of the current period. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in accounting policies for recognition, classification and \\r\\nmeasurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets.  \\r\\n \\r\\nClassification and measurement \\r\\n\\r\\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component \\r\\n(determined in accordance with IFRS 15) at their transaction price. Other financial assets and financial liabilities \\r\\nare measured at initial recognition at their fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial \\r\\nliability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or \\r\\nissue of the financial asset or financial liability. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent measurement of financial assets depends on the classification performed by the Group at initial \\r\\nrecognition. At initial recognition, financial assets can be classified into one of the following categories: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets measured at amortised cost. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nClassification is performed based on both the Group’s business model for managing financial assets and the \\r\\ncharacteristics of contractual cash flows of the financial assets. However, financial assets that meet the amortised \\r\\n\\r\\ncost or fair value through other comprehensive income measurement criteria, may be designated on initial \\r\\nrecognition by the Group to fair value through profit or loss measurement option, provided that particular \\r\\n\\r\\nqualifying criteria are met. Additionally, the Group may make an irrevocable election at initial recognition for \\r\\nparticular investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value through profit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\nto present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. \\r\\nOn initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified into one of the following categories: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Group AB \\r\\nINTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION \\r\\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2018  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n(all amounts are in EUR thousand, if not otherwise stated) \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPage 17 of 35 \\r\\n\\r\\nACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (continued \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nFinancial liability is classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss if: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 It meets the definition of held for trading and \\r\\n\\uf0b7 It is designated upon initial recognition to fair value through profit or loss measurement option. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll other financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment of financial assets \\r\\nIFRS 9 fundamentally changed the credit loss recognition methodology. The standard replaced IAS 39’s incurred \\r\\nloss approach with a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. The Bank is required to recognize an \\r\\nallowance for expected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan \\r\\ncommitments and financial guarantee contracts. The allowance is based on the expected credit losses associated \\r\\nwith the probability of default in the next twelve months unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk \\r\\nsince origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the probability of default over the life of the asset. Loss \\r\\nallowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for purchased or originated credit-\\r\\nimpaired assets (POCI) regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument. The Bank has \\r\\nestablished a policy to perform an assessment at the end of each reporting period of whether credit risk has \\r\\nincreased significantly since initial recognition by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the \\r\\nremaining life of the financial instrument.  \\r\\n \\r\\nThe assets to test for impairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  \\r\\nStage 1 includes assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk or which are classified as low \\r\\nrisk (rating categorised as “Investment grade” or higher), stage 2 includes assets where there has been a \\r\\nsignificant increase in credit risk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets. Significant assets in stage 3 are tested for \\r\\nimpairment on an individual basis, while for insignificant assets a collective assessment is performed. In stage 1, \\r\\nthe allowances equal the 12 month expected credit loss. In stage 2 and 3, the allowances equal the lifetime \\r\\nexpected credit losses.  \\r\\n \\r\\nOne important driver for size of allowances under IFRS 9 is the trigger for transferring an asset from Stage 1 to \\r\\nStage 2. Luminor has decided to use a mix of absolute and relative changes (0.6 p.p. and 2.5 times) in 12 month \\r\\npoint-in-time Probability of Default (PD) to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. \\r\\nIn addition, customers with forbearance measures, included in watch list and contracts with payments more than \\r\\nthirty days past due are also transferred to Stage 2. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe agreed IFRS 9 impairment methodology is documented in internal procedures, applied in daily life, integration \\r\\ninto front office business processes follows and is intended to be finalized during the year 2018, but this does not \\r\\nimpact impairment calculation.  In general, IFRS 9 impairment model results in earlier recognition of credit losses \\r\\nfor the respective items and increases the amount of loss allowances recognised for these items. Moreover, the \\r\\nimpairment calculations under IFRS 9 are more volatile and pro-cyclical than under IAS 39, mainly due to the \\r\\nsignificant subjectivity applied in the forward looking scenarios.

IFRS 15 establishes a five-step \\r\\nmodel that will apply to revenue earned from a contract with a customer (with limited exceptions), regardless of \\r\\nthe type of revenue transaction or the industry. The standard’s requirements also apply to the recognition and \\r\\nmeasurement of gains and losses on the sale of some non-financial assets that are not an output of the entity’s \\r\\nordinary activities (e.g., sales of property, plant and equipment or intangibles). Extensive disclosures will be \\r\\nrequired, including disaggregation of total revenue; information about performance obligations; changes in \\r\\ncontract asset and liability account balances between periods and key judgments and estimates. Management \\r\\nhas assessed that the application of the standard did not have any effect on the Bank and the Group financial \\r\\nstatements.  \\r\\n  \\r\\nThe core principle of IFRS 15 is that revenue must be recognised to reflect the transfer of services to customers \\r\\nat an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for such services. This \\r\\ncore principle is applied through a five-step model: \\r\\n\\r\\n1) Identify the contract with the customer,  \\r\\n2) Identify the performance obligation in the contract, \\r\\n3) Determine the transaction price, \\r\\n4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract, \\r\\n5) Recognise revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFor each performance obligation identified the Group determines at contract inception whether it satisfies the \\r\\nperformance obligation over time or at a point in time, whether the consideration is fixed or variable, including \\r\\nwhether consideration is constrained due to external factors. Consideration is subsequently allocated to the \\r\\nidentified performance obligation.  \\r\\n \\r\\nFor services provided over time, consideration is recognised when the service is provided to the customer \\r\\nassuming that a significant reversal of consideration will not occur. Examples of income earned for services \\r\\nsatisfied over time include the fee income earned for the asset management services.  \\r\\n \\r\\nIf a performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time then the income is recognised when the service is \\r\\ntransferred to the customer. Examples of such income include fee income for executing transactions (clearing and \\r\\nsettlement, customers’ securities trading, payment cards transaction fees). \\r\\n \\r\\nIFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Clarifications) \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Clarifications apply for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. \\r\\nThe objective of the Clarifications is to clarify the IASB’s intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15 \\r\\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers, particularly the accounting of identifying performance obligations \\r\\namending the wording of the “separately identifiable” principle, of principal versus agent considerations including \\r\\nthe assessment of whether an entity is a principal or an agent as well as applications of control principle and of \\r\\nlicensing providing additional guidance for accounting of intellectual property and royalties. The Clarifications also \\r\\nprovide additional practical expedients for entities that either apply IFRS 15 fully retrospectively or that elect to \\r\\napply the modified retrospective approach. As described above, management has assessed that the application \\r\\nof the standard did not have any material effect on the Bank and the Group financial statements. \\r\\n \\r\\nIFRS 16 Leases \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases as of January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, \\r\\nmeasurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single \\r\\non-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17. The standard includes two \\r\\nrecognition exemptions for lessees – leases of ’low-value’ assets (e.g., personal computers) and short-term \\r\\nleases (i.e., leases with a lease term of 12 months or less).  \\r\\n \\r\\nAt the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments (i.e., the lease \\r\\nliability) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e., the right-of-use \\r\\nasset). Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the \\r\\ndepreciation expense on the right-of-use asset. Lessees will be also required to remeasure the lease liability upon \\r\\nthe occurrence of certain events (e.g., a change in the lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting \\r\\nfrom a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments). The lessee will generally recognise the \\r\\namount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. \\r\\n \\r\\nIn 2018, the Group will continue to assess the potential effect of IFRS 16 on its consolidated financial statements. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Group AB \\r\\nINTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION \\r\\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2018  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n(all amounts are in EUR thousand, if not otherwise stated) \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPage 22 of 35 \\r\\n\\r\\nRISK MANAGEMENT \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and \\r\\ndisclosures required in the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with the Group's \\r\\nannual financial statements as at 31 December 2017.  \\r\\n \\r\\nThere have been no major changes in the risk management or in any risk management policies since the year \\r\\nend. \\r\\n \\r\\nKey judgments, inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used to assessing expected credit losses. \\r\\n \\r\\nWith the adoption of IFRS 9 three stages model was introduced: \\r\\nStage 1 – part of the portfolio for which no significant deterioration in credit quality has occurred since initial \\r\\nrecognition (or the exposure is of low credit risk) and the financial instrument is not considered credit-impaired; \\r\\nStage 2 – part of the portfolio for which significant deterioration in credit quality has occurred since initial \\r\\nrecognition, evidenced by the SICR – significant increase in credit risk - indicator, and the financial instrument is \\r\\nnot considered credit-impaired; \\r\\nStage 3 – credit-impaired part of the portfolio. Luminor equates default and credit-impairment definitions so that all \\r\\ndefaulted exposures are treated as credit-impaired and all credit-impaired exposures are treated as defaulted. \\r\\nThis approach is based on the fact that the default definition used by Luminor covers all events indicated by IFRS \\r\\n9 as possible evidence that financial instrument is credit-impaired and all of these events are considered by \\r\\nLuminor as having a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows from the instrument. \\r\\nAdditional category is POCI financial assets - financial assets that were purchased or originated as credit-\\r\\nimpaired. POCI assets are subject to unchanging classification, i.e. financial asset once classified as POCI \\r\\nremains in this group until derecognized. The POCI classification is determined at financial instrument level. \\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor applies low credit risk exemption to the following classes of exposures: \\r\\n\\uf0b7 central governments, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 central bank, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 regional governments, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 local authorities and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 institutions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe counterparty must fulfil the condition of having credit rating indicating investment grade. \\r\\n \\r\\nGenerally the financial asset is treated as facing significant increase in credit risk if at least one of the following \\r\\nSICR indicators is identified after initial recognition of the financial instrument and was not present as of its \\r\\norigination: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Significant increase of 12-month PD – significant increase of point-in-time (PIT) forward-looking 12-month \\r\\n\\r\\nPD since initial recognition until reporting date (2.5 times and 0.6 p.p. jointly), \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Risk grade 9 or 10 – risk grade 9 or 10 as of reporting date, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 30 days past due – more than 30 days past due as of reporting date, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Forborne performing – forborne performing status as of reporting date (forbearance not triggering non-\\r\\n\\r\\nperforming status) in accordance with FINREP instruction reporting requirements, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Watch list – watch list status as of reporting date. \\r\\nAll of the SICR indicators are recognized at financial instrument level in order to track changes in credit risk since \\r\\ninitial recognition date for particular financial instrument, even though some of them refer to the customer’s \\r\\ncharacteristics. \\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor identifies default when either or both of the following default indicators have taken place:  \\r\\n1. The customer is past due more than 90 days on any material obligation to the Luminor;  \\r\\n2. The customer is considered unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Luminor.  \\r\\nFor exposure to banks the default is recognized when payments are due more than 7 days. \\r\\nFor the purpose of unlikeliness to pay identification, elements taken as indications of unlikeliness to pay include \\r\\nthe following: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Distressed restructuring of credit obligation (forbearance triggering non-performing status in accordance with \\r\\n\\r\\nFINREP instruction requirements);  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Major financial problems of the customer (present or expected), i.e. significant financial difficulties; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Recognition of specific credit risk adjustment resulting from a significant decline in credit quality of the \\r\\n\\r\\nexposure; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Bankruptcy of the customer or similar protection; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Group AB \\r\\nINTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION \\r\\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2018  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n(all amounts are in EUR thousand, if not otherwise stated) \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPage 23 of 35 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Disappearance of an active market for a financial asset because of financial difficulties of the customer; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Sell of credit obligation at material credit-related economic loss; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Credit fraud; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 External rating indicating default. \\r\\nThe default is recognised on customer level. \\r\\nReturn to a non-defaulted status is possible not earlier than after 3 months when all default triggers cease to be \\r\\nmet. During these 3 months of the probation period the timely payments by a customer should be ensured. The \\r\\nexemption from the general rule of probation is the distressed restructuring where at least 1 year needs to pass \\r\\nsince the moment of extending restructuring measures and the moment when a customer is deemed to have an \\r\\nability to comply with the post-restructuring conditions. This approach is consistent with FINREP instruction \\r\\nrequirements for cure of forborne non-performing exposures. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the shift from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 approach incurred loss model was replaced by expected credit loss (ECL) \\r\\nmodel. For Stage 1 financial assets loss allowances equal to 12-month ECL while for Stage 2 and Stage 3 \\r\\nfinancial instruments lifetime ECL is calculated.  \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Purchased or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) financial assets ECL is estimated in the lifetime horizon till \\r\\nthe maturity. The loss expected at initial recognition is referred to as Initial impairment. At subsequent periods \\r\\nonly the cumulative changes in the lifetime expected credit losses, since initial recognition, are recognised in profit \\r\\nor loss. Collective assessment of impairment is performed for all financial instruments that are not defaulted as of \\r\\nthe reporting date, i.e. are classified to either Stage 1 or Stage 2 or are non-defaulted POCI asset. The expected \\r\\nloss is calculated as probability weighted average of losses expected in different macroeconomic scenarios. \\r\\nExpected loss in concrete macroeconomic scenario is calculated as the multiple of probability of default (PD), loss \\r\\ngiven default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and cumulative prepayment rate and is discounted using effective \\r\\ninterest rate. PD curves, LGD curves and EAD curves are estimated for all months until the maturity date of the \\r\\nfacility. If the facility is classified to Stage 1, expected losses are estimated over the period of up to 12 months. If \\r\\nthe facility is classified to Stage 2 then the expected loss is estimated over the period up to maturity date of the \\r\\nfacility. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nEstimation of PD and LGD curves take into account forward looking macroeconomic information. Methodology of \\r\\nestimation of these risk parameters includes modelling of the relationship between risk parameters and \\r\\nmacroeconomic variables. Forecasts of macroeconomic variables under different scenarios for 3 upcoming years \\r\\ntogether with scenario probabilities are prepared by Luminor macroeconomists. Three macroeconomic scenarios \\r\\nare considered: baseline/realistic, positive, and pessimistic scenario (with the probability weights of 60 %, 25 % \\r\\nand 15 % respectively). Macroeconomic scenarios that are prepared for the estimation of expected losses are \\r\\nconsistent with scenarios which are used in credit risk stress testing process. Macroeconomic variables that are \\r\\nincluded in the modelling are annual change in real GDP, unemployment rate and annual change of residential \\r\\nreal estate price. Starting from the fourth year it is assumed that risk parameters (PD and LGD) converge to their \\r\\nlong term average levels. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stage 3 exposures (or defaulted POCI assets), which are classified as material, Luminor evaluates \\r\\nthe impairment amount on individual basis (individual assessment) under discounted cash flows (DCF) method. \\r\\nTwo scenarios – base case and risk case – are used. For exceptional cases usage of one scenario can be \\r\\nsufficient. The circumstances when only one scenario might be acceptable could be the deep workout case or the \\r\\ncase when total exposure of defaulted borrower falls below the materiality threshold. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stage 3 exposures (or defaulted POCI assets), which are classified as immaterial, Luminor evaluates \\r\\nthe impairment amount on collective basis (collective assessment). Impairment is calculated applying the pool \\r\\nrate for unsecured part. Different pool rates are applied for these pools distinguished by Luminor: \\r\\n\\uf0b7 mortgage loans and private credits to private individuals, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 consumer loans and other loans to private individuals (including leasing), \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 SMEs (all financial instruments to legal entities). \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Group AB \\r\\nINTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION \\r\\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2018  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n(all amounts are in EUR thousand, if not otherwise stated) \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPage 24 of 35 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nG1.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued) \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nFinancial instruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value: \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \\r\\n \\r\\nLevel 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value     \\r\\nmeasurement is directly or indirectly observable. \\r\\n  \\r\\nLevel 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value \\r\\nmeasurement is unobservable. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe fair value of all Bank contracted derivatives  is defined as level 2. These are interest rate swaps and in all \\r\\ncases pricing is based on market observable inputs. For assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a \\r\\nrecurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-\\r\\nassessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a \\r\\nwhole) at the end of each reporting period. There were no movement of securities between the levels during 2018. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of shares on level 3 are as follows: \\r\\nconversion rate, average trading price, liquidity discount. \\r\\n \\r\\nPrinciples for information about the fair values of financial instruments which are carried at amortised cost \\r\\n\\r\\nFor assets and liabilities not carried at fair value book value is estimated to be a reasonable approximation of fair \\r\\nvalue. Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial \\r\\nposition cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that \\r\\ninclude the use of mathematical models. The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data \\r\\nwhere possible, but where observable market data is not available, judgment is required to establish fair values.  \\r\\nThe fair value of loans to customers, customer deposits, amounts due from credit institutions and amounts due to \\r\\ncredit institutions and other financial assets and liabilities, obligations under finance leases is estimated by \\r\\ndiscounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining \\r\\nmaturities. \\r\\n \\r\\nIn assessing the fair value for financial assets, the management has performed discounted cash flow analysis; up-\\r\\nto-date market information at assessment moment is being used for assessing cash flows. For loans, where base \\r\\ninterest rates are pegged to floating market interest rates, the Group has considered difference between average \\r\\ninterest margin of issued loans and average interest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan \\r\\nportfolio this margin has not been changed (increased) since issuance, the Group has estimated that for such \\r\\nloans the carrying value is considered equal to fair value. \\r\\nFair value of financial liabilities at amortized cost such as Loans and deposits from credit institutions and Deposits \\r\\nfrom customers which are not on demand have been estimated based on discounted cash flow model using \\r\\ninterest rates for similar products as at period end. Fair value of those financial liabilities that are on demand or \\r\\nhave floating interest rate have been estimated to be approximately equal to its carrying amount. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe table below summarizes the fair values of financial assets and liabilities recognized at amortized cost in the \\r\\nstatement of financial position instruments: \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 June 2018 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets        \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to credit institutions  107 475 42 555 150 030 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to the public   11 717 276 11 717 276 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total \\r\\n\\r\\nDue to credit institutions  1 669 657 2 718 363 4 388 020 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost   1 637 749 6 658 918 8 296 667 \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Group AB \\r\\nINTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION \\r\\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2018  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n(all amounts are in EUR thousand, if not otherwise stated) \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPage 32 of 35 \\r\\n\\r\\nG 11.

Total shareholder equity of Luminor amounts to 1.8 billion euros and is \\r\\ncapitalised at CET1 17.3%. Luminor’s vision is to become the best financial ecosystem for its customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, an agreement was signed between DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank AB with US-based private equity firm \\r\\nBlackstone to sell the majority stake in Luminor. As part of the transaction, Blackstone will acquire a 60% majority stake in the \\r\\nbank. Nordea and DNB will retain equal 20% equity stakes in Luminor and will continue to support the bank with long term funding, \\r\\nexpertise and ongoing representation on the Board of Directors. Additionally, Blackstone has entered into an agreement with \\r\\nNordea to purchase their remaining 20% stake over the coming years. Closing of the transaction is subject to European Central \\r\\nBank’s and local supervisory authorities’ approvals and is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis transaction represents the largest majority-stake acquisition of a universal bank by private equity in the last decade globally, \\r\\nand one of the largest M&A transactions in Baltic history.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (or “Luminor Estonia”) offers a wide range of products and services to its customers in all channels, digital and \\r\\nphysical, with headquarters in Tallinn and 10 offices in Tartu, Pärnu, Viljandi, Rakvere and Jõhvi, in addition a cashless advisory \\r\\ndesk in Kuressaare. Luminor has a total of 100 ATMs throughout Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of Q3 2018, Luminor Estonia employed ca 700 full-time employees and served ca 139,000 clients in the private and \\r\\nbusiness segments, with a market share of 17% in lending and 10% in deposits, making it the third-largest financial service provider \\r\\non the market. Luminor Estonia’s capital ratio at the end of Q3 2018 in Estonia was 18.09% Common Equity Tier 1 capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Estonia has five subsidiaries: Luminor Liising AS, which provides leasing for vehicles, heavy equipment and other assets; \\r\\nLuminor Pensions Estonia AS, which focuses on growing the pension assets of clients; Luminor Kindlustusmaakler OÜ, which \\r\\nprovides insurance broker services; and Promano OÜ and Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ, which provide asset management services. \\r\\n\\r\\nMoody’s has assigned first time long- and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, as well as a local \\r\\ncurrency long-term (P)Baa2 senior MTN rating to Luminor Bank AS.\\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview\\r\\nAs expected, Estonia’s economic momentum has marginally moderated in Q2 2018 to 3.7% y/y from the exceptionally brisk pace \\r\\nseen at the end of last year (5% y/y in Q4). As a key positive development, export growth has picked up speed in Q2 after a weak start \\r\\nto the year. However, the key drag resulted from investments. In terms of industry branches, the most substantial contributions \\r\\nto growth came from construction and the export-orientated manufacturing sector, followed by science and technology and the \\r\\npivotal ICT (Information And Communication Technology) branches. As expected, consumers’ appetite remains rather stable on \\r\\nthe back of strong labour markets. Consumers have not really opted to spend the extra income received from the past taxation \\r\\nreform (which effectively increased the non-taxable income). \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia’s underlying growth is expected to continue to be broad-based with cyclical indicators in the domestic and external sectors \\r\\n(including economic and consumer confidence) pointing to momentum carrying over into H2. Manufacturing value added growth \\r\\nhas continued at a healthy single-digit pace with stable export orders complemented by strong domestic demand. Estonia’s open \\r\\neconomy is highly integrated with the economies of the euro area and the Nordic countries, and will continue to develop hand in \\r\\nhand with them. The three key trade partners: Finland, Sweden and Germany represent 40% of Estonia’s direct exports. Economic \\r\\ngrowth in the medium term will depend more on investments in productivity, since the increase in employment will be contained \\r\\nand a more moderate growth pace is also expected in the external markets. Only gradual moderation of current strong growth is \\r\\nforeseen for next year as the economy faces headwinds in the external sector.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the risks to the 3.5% y/y growth forecast for 2018 remain rather balanced as rising capacity constraints and new flow of EU \\r\\nstructural funds are expected to contribute to gradual recovery in investments. With a solid growth outlook and unemployment at \\r\\napprox. 6% in H1, households remain confident about their future economic prospects. Consumer appetite for major purchases \\r\\nremains at a high level, supporting the outlook for the residential real estate market, which has seen stable demand and close to \\r\\neuro-area-average price increases.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivities\\r\\nDuring Q3 2018, Luminor continued with the legal aspects of its merger, which will see the full integration of the banks, continuing \\r\\noperations in all three Baltic States through the Estonian bank and its registered branches in Latvia and Lithuania. In May 2018, \\r\\nLuminor received confirmation from the European Central Bank that the branches in Latvia and Lithuania could be established \\r\\nand commence operations. The cross border merger and legal change is expected to take place starting from 2 January 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4\\r\\n\\r\\nHousehold segment\\r\\nLuminor’s brand value lies in its close relationship with its customers and services. By the end of Q3 2018, Luminor Estonia \\r\\nhad approximately 116,000 household clients. Average lending and deposit volumes remained stable. Delivering good customer \\r\\nexperiences and meeting our customers’ needs are essential to Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is continuing to automate and digitalise products and services to meet customers’ needs and expectations. The majority \\r\\nof meetings with our clients and active client communication go through remote channels. Starting from 1 July 2018, all bank cards \\r\\nfor day-to-day operations are renewed automatically and sent conveniently to customers by post.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur goal is to become the home bank for our target customers by offering professional advice and excellent customer service. \\r\\nDuring Q3 2018, Luminor Estonia household segment focused on activation of home bank customer transactions. We want our \\r\\ncustomers to actively use Luminor bank cards and be more active in terms of their daily financial operations. This goal was \\r\\nsupported by Luminor’s card activation campaign aimed at customers who already have a bank card.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking segment\\r\\nOur Private Banking customer activities are centred on everyday banking and growing the savings portfolio. We help high net worth \\r\\nindividuals and their families to grow, manage and preserve their wealth. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of Q3, Luminor Estonia had around 1,000 Private Banking customers. Private Banking gained momentum in Q3 2018 with \\r\\npositive growth in deposits area,  resulting in growth of 39 million euros during the third quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Q3 2018, Private Banking focused on strategic positioning and attracting new funding through collaboration with Luminor’s \\r\\nother business segments and marketing to help deliver results. We held a Private Banking customers event on 13 September 2018 \\r\\nwhere we gave insights on upcoming macroeconomic trends.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness and corporate client segments\\r\\nIn Q3 2018, Luminor Estonia continued to serve its ca 22,000 customers in the corporate and business client segments. Luminor \\r\\nEstonia continued profitable lending growth to small and medium-sized business clients. We have strengthened our position in the \\r\\nagricultural sector and focused on increasing our customer base and customer activity in the business client segment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe activities were supported by regional marketing events and marketing campaign to help to deliver improved customer service \\r\\ntowards business clients.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate client segment results were in line with macroeconomic developments. Lending to large corporations and international \\r\\ncustomers had a positive impact in lending profitability and growth in deposits. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur corporate customers value our tailored financial products and services because they help them to operate efficiently and \\r\\ngrow. In Q3 Luminor Estonia, held its annual customer event to strengthen our relationship with our target customers in the \\r\\nbusiness, corporate and private client segments.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing\\r\\nLeasing services for vehicles, heavy equipment and other assets for private individuals and business clients are provided through \\r\\nthe subsidiary Luminor Liising AS. In Q3 2018, the total leasing portfolio amounted to 947 million euros. Sales were supported \\r\\nthrough active campaigns with vendors and active sales via bank channels to the business and household customer segments.\\r\\n\\r\\nPensions\\r\\nLuminor Estonia continued to provide 2nd and 3rd pillar and employer pension fund management services to its customers \\r\\nthrough its subsidiary Luminor Pensions Estonia AS. Luminor Estonia’s first pension funds celebrated their 10th anniversary on 15 \\r\\nSeptember 2018 with very strong results. Luminor funds topped the 10-year performance chart, outperforming the competition   \\r\\nin both 2nd and 3rd pillar. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of Q3 2018, assets under management had reached 329 million euros increasing by 3.5% compared to Q2 and the \\r\\nnumber of clients grew as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate social responsibility in Luminor\\r\\nWe are creating a new-generation financial services provider because we are determined to build a better tomorrow – for families \\r\\nand businesses and for the communities and countries in which we live and operate. We believe in contributing to the development \\r\\nof the local communities in which we operate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are committed to taking into account corporate governance, social conditions and environment in all of our activities, including \\r\\nproduct and service development, advisory services and sales, investment and credit decisions, and other operations. We do not \\r\\ncontribute to the infringement of human or labour rights, corruption, serious environmental harm or other actions that could be \\r\\nregarded as unethical. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a responsibility to undertake efforts to ensure that the banking industry delivers ethical products and services, and \\r\\nwe take responsibility for to whom and how the products and services will be offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnti-money laundering related matters\\r\\nAt Luminor, we have zero tolerance towards money laundering and other financial crime risk. Luminor has developed and \\r\\nimplemented a comprehensive set of measures to identify, manage and control its risks. We comply with sanctions laws and follow \\r\\nthe guidelines, recommendations and standards issued by local regulatory and supervisory authorities and relevant international \\r\\norganizations, as well as those issued by local banking associations and financial intelligence units in each Baltic state.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Compliance and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) functions are operating at the pan-Baltic level, having competence centres \\r\\nand highly experienced professionals in the following areas: data protection, AML/ Certified Fraud Examiners (CFT), FATCA, IT \\r\\ncompliance and digital channels, business integrity, bank products & new product development. Luminor’s AML, Compliance and \\r\\nAnti-Financial Crime units employs over 100 professionals, maintaining a robust compliance framework and processes through \\r\\nthe organization.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant events after 30 September 2018\\r\\nLuminor has recently established a Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme, which enables Luminor to issue bonds under \\r\\nstandardized documentation. The programme has two purposes - to replace funding from the owner banks and to support and \\r\\nfund our customer business. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnder this programme, Luminor will be able to issue debt in different sizes and maturities going forward. On 10 October, Luminor \\r\\nissued a 350-million-euro senior unsecured inaugural public bond with a maturity of three years and coupon of 150 bps. The bond \\r\\nwill be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange. The issue was well supported by the Baltic community and international accounts, having \\r\\na total of 46 investors spread over 14 different countries. Bonds were issued by Luminor Bank Estonia, taking into account both the \\r\\nupcoming change in its ownership structure and Luminor’s cross-border merger to become one centralised bank under Estonia \\r\\nwith Latvia and Lithuania as branches starting from January 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 October, Moody´s Investor Service assigned to Luminor Bank a senior unsecured MTN rating of Baa2, which followed the \\r\\nissuance of senior debt within the scope of provisionally rated senior unsecured EMTN program carrying a long-term rating of \\r\\n(P) Baa2. The rationale for the senior unsecured EMTN program rating is explained in the Moody´s Investor Service rating action \\r\\nreleased on 13 September 2018.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOther events\\r\\nMonika Peetson was recalled from Luminor Bank AS Management Board on 11. November 2018. Starting from 12 November 2018, \\r\\nAndrius Nacajus was appointed as a new Member of the Management Board. The Management Board of Luminor Bank AS consists \\r\\nof 3 members elected by the Supervisory Council. As of 12 November 2018, the members are Gunnar Toomemets (chairman), \\r\\nSander Klaos and Andrius Nacajus.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Results\\r\\nThe merger of the Baltic businesses of DNB and Nordea in October 2017 has had a significant impact both on the financial result \\r\\nand operational focus. The consolidated financial information prior to the merger represents consolidated results of DNB’s \\r\\nrespective entities, whereas starting from 1 October 2017, such financial information also reflects the effects of the acquisition of \\r\\nassets and liabilities of Nordea. As a result, comparability of consolidated financial information between January-September 2017 \\r\\nand January-September 2018 is limited in light of the effects of the merger.\\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit earned in Q3 2018 was 7.1 million euros, which was 7.5 million euros less than Q2 2018 mainly due to reversals of \\r\\nimpairment losses on loans, which increased the profit in Q2 2018. Net interest margin remained stable at 1.8%. Net fees and \\r\\ncommission income from both corporate and household clients increased 3% in Q3 2018 compared to Q2 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6\\r\\n\\r\\nKEY FIGURES*                                                                                            \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR Jan-Sep 2018 Q3 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit 24\\u2009476 7 081\\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity 467\\u2009385 468 998\\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE), % 7.0 6.0\\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets 3\\u2009780\\u2009807 3 943 547\\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA), % 0.9 0.7\\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 53\\u2009206 17 641\\r\\n\\r\\nAVERAGE INTEREST EARNING ASSETS 3\\u2009745\\u2009001 3 904 505\\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM), % 1.9 1.8\\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio (C/I), % 65.0 5 6.7\\r\\n\\r\\n*Quarterly ratios and Jan-Sept 2018 ratios (ROE, ROA, NIM, C/I) have been expressed on an annualized basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nExplanations:\\r\\nAverage equity (belonging to owners of company) = (equity at end of reporting period + equity at end of previous period) / 2\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) = Net profit / Average equity * 100%\\r\\nAverage assets = (assets at end of reporting period + assets at end of previous period) / 2\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) = Net profit / Assets, average * 100\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets = (interest-earning assets at end of reporting period + interest-earning assets at end of previous period) / 2\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) = Net interest income / Interest earning assets, average * 100\\r\\nCost / Income ratio = Total operating expenses / Total net income * 100\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers remained stable at 3.3 billion euros at 30 September 2018.

Long-term funding was committed for 6 years (4+2), beginning from the 1 October \\r\\n2017 when Luminor was established and short-term funding in the form of revolving credit of 364 days. In addition to the current \\r\\noutstanding utilized funding, there is also a committed credit line of 0.92 billion euros in place (not utilized at present). When Luminor \\r\\nattracts wholesale long-term (longer than one year) funding externally, the intent is to amortize an equal amount of parent funding.\\r\\n\\r\\nRating\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, Moody’s assigned first-time deposit ratings to Luminor Bank AS with a stable outlook on long-term deposit \\r\\nratings.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS \\r\\nIn 2018-2019, an internal corporate restructuring of Luminor Group will take place with the aim of concentrating the entire Baltic \\r\\nbusinesses of Luminor Group in Luminor Bank AS, a credit institution in Estonia; where Luminor Bank AS in Estonia will remain \\r\\nas the surviving entity while Luminor Bank AB in Lithuania and Luminor Bank AS in Latvia will be merged into Luminor Bank AS in \\r\\nEstonia and cease to exist. A cross-border merger would be pursued under Directive (EU) 2017/1132 of the European Parliament \\r\\nand of the Council of 14 June 2017 relating to certain aspects of company law as implemented in Lithuania, Latvia and\\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia, respectively. All assets and liabilities of the respective subsidiaries would, in accordance with the relevant laws, be \\r\\ntransferred into the Luminor Bank AS in Estonia as a matter of universal succession, and each subsidiary will cease to exist as a \\r\\nlegal entity upon registration of the cross-border merger. Following the merger, Luminor Bank AS in Estonia will pursue banking \\r\\nbusiness in Lithuania and Latvia through its branches starting from 2 January 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2018 Luminor received confirmation from the European Central Bank that the branches in Latvia and Lithuania could be \\r\\nestablished and commence operations. On 28 June 2018 Luminor received regulatory approval from the European Central Bank \\r\\nto carry out the cross-border merger.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current interim report, “Bank” (or Luminor Bank AS) refers to Luminor Bank AS. “Group” refers to the consolidated financial \\r\\nstatements of Luminor Bank AS and its subsidiaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 September 2018 Bank owned the following subsidiaries:\\r\\n • Luminor Liising AS (leasing and factoring activities),\\r\\n • Luminor Pensions Estonia AS (management of funds),\\r\\n • Promano Est OÜ (real estate management),\\r\\n • Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ (real estate management),\\r\\n • Luminor Kindlustusmaakler OÜ (insurance brokerage).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 September 2018 the Bank owned 100% of the share capital of all subsidiaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\\r\\n\\r\\nBasis of preparation\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (the Bank or the Group) was prepared in accordance with IAS 34 \\r\\nInterim Financial reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed interim financial information does not contain all \\r\\nthe information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s \\r\\nannual financial statements as at 31 December 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed interim financial information are consistent with those \\r\\nfollowed in the preparation of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, except the new \\r\\naccounting standards which came into force from 1 January 2018 and are described below.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges in accounting policies\\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments\\r\\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 9 as issued by the IASB in July 2014 with a date of adoption of 1 January 2018, which resulted in \\r\\nchanges in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. The Group did \\r\\nnot early-adopt IFRS 9 in previous periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group elected not to restate comparative figures. Any adjustment to the \\r\\ncarrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings of \\r\\nthe current period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in the changes in accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of \\r\\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. \\r\\n\\r\\nClassification and measurement\\r\\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component (determined \\r\\nin accordance with IFRS 15) at their transaction price. Other financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at initial \\r\\nrecognition at their fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n17\\r\\n\\r\\nloss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent measurement of the financial assets depends on the classification performed by the Group at initial recognition. At \\r\\ninitial recognition, financial assets can be classified into one of the following categories:\\r\\n\\r\\n • Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss,\\r\\n • Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI),\\r\\n • Financial assets measured at amortised cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nClassification is performed based on both the Group’s business model for managing financial assets and the characteristics of \\r\\ncontractual cash flows of the financial assets. However, financial assets that meet the amortised cost or fair value through other \\r\\ncomprehensive income measurement criteria, may be designated on initial recognition by the Group to fair value through profit \\r\\nor loss measurement option, provided that particular qualifying criteria are met. Additionally, the Group may make an irrevocable \\r\\nelection at initial recognition for particular investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value \\r\\nthrough profit or loss to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified into one of the following categories:\\r\\n • Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost,\\r\\n • Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nA financial liability is classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss if:\\r\\n • It meets the definition of “held for trading” and\\r\\n • It is designated upon initial recognition to fair value through the profit or loss measurement option.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll other financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment of financial assets\\r\\nIFRS 9 fundamentally changed the credit loss recognition methodology. The standard replaced IAS 39’s incurred loss approach \\r\\nwith a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. The Bank is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses \\r\\nfor all loans and other debt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. \\r\\nThe allowance is based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default in the next twelve months unless \\r\\nthere has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the probability of \\r\\ndefault over the life of the asset. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for purchased or \\r\\noriginated credit-impaired assets (POCI) regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument. The Bank \\r\\nhas established a policy to perform an assessment at the end of each reporting period of whether credit risk has increased \\r\\nsignificantly since initial recognition by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the \\r\\nfinancial instrument. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe assets to test for impairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes \\r\\nassets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk or which are classified as low risk (rating categorised as \\r\\n“Investment grade” or higher), stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 \\r\\nincludes defaulted assets. Significant assets in stage 3 are tested for impairment on an individual basis, while for insignificant \\r\\nassets a collective assessment is performed. In stage 1, the allowances equal the 12-month expected credit loss. In stage 2 and 3, \\r\\nthe allowances equal the lifetime expected credit losses. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne important driver for size of allowances under IFRS 9 is the trigger for transferring an asset from Stage 1 to Stage 2. The Bank \\r\\nhas decided to use a mix of absolute and relative changes (0.6 p.p. and 2.5 times) in 12-month point-in-time Probability of Default \\r\\n(PD) to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. In addition, customers with forbearance measures, \\r\\nincluded on the watch list and contracts with payments more than thirty days past due are also transferred to Stage 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agreed IFRS 9 impairment methodology is documented in internal procedures and applied in daily life. Integration into front \\r\\noffice business processes follows and is intended to be finalized during the year 2018, but this does not impact impairment \\r\\ncalculation. In general, IFRS 9 impairment model results in earlier recognition of credit losses for the respective items and \\r\\nincreases the amount of loss allowances recognised for these items. Moreover, the impairment calculations under IFRS 9 are more \\r\\nvolatile and pro-cyclical than under IAS 39, mainly due to the significant subjectivity applied in the forward-looking scenarios. IFRS \\r\\n9 impairment requirements are applied retrospectively, with transition impact recognized in retained earnings at 1 January 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n18\\r\\n\\r\\nImpact of the adoption of IFRS 9\\r\\nSet out below are disclosures relating to the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the Group.\\r\\n\\r\\nClassification and measurement of financial instruments\\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement category and the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 and IFRS 9 as at \\r\\nJanuary 2018 are compared as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nFinancial assets\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal measurement \\r\\ncategory under \\r\\n\\r\\nIAS 39\\r\\n\\r\\nNew measurement \\r\\ncategory under \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\nIAS 39 \\r\\ncarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nNew carrying \\r\\namount under IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\n1 January 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central \\r\\nbanks\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables Amortised cost 199 250 199 250\\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions Loans and receivables Amortised cost 148 893 148 888\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\nthrough profit or loss\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at \\r\\nFVTPL \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at \\r\\nFVTPL \\r\\n\\r\\n4 526 4 526\\r\\n\\r\\nDerivatives\\r\\nFair value through \\r\\n\\r\\nprofit or loss\\r\\nFair value through \\r\\n\\r\\nprofit or loss\\r\\n4 161 4 161\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables Loans and receivables Amortised cost 3 221 001 3 207 207\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no changes for classification and measurement of financial liabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nReconciliation of impairment allowance balance from IAS 39 to IFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table reconciles the prior period’s closing impairment allowance measured in accordance with the IAS 39 incurred \\r\\nloss model to the new impairment allowance measured in accordance with the IFRS 9 expected loss model as at 1 January 2018:\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nFinancial assets\\r\\n\\r\\nLoss allowance under IAS 39/\\r\\nProvision under IAS 37 Reclassifications Remeasurements\\r\\n\\r\\nCredit loss allowance \\r\\nunder IFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\nAmortised cost\\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks - - - -\\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 0 - -5 -5\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables -43 699 - -13 794 -57 493\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal -43 699 - -13 799 -57 498\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nFinancial liabilities Provision under IAS 37 Reclassifications Remeasurements\\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 carrying amount \\r\\n1 January 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nProvisions 650 - 372 1 022\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 650 - 372 1 022\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n19\\r\\n\\r\\nReconciliation of statement of financial position balances from IAS 39 to IFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table reconciles the carrying amounts of financial assets, from their previous measurement category in accordance \\r\\nwith IAS 39 to their new measurement categories upon transition to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018:\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nFinancial assets\\r\\n\\r\\nIAS 39 carrying amount \\r\\n31 December 2017 Reclassifications Remeasurements \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 carrying amount \\r\\n1 January 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nAmortised cost     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks    \\r\\n\\r\\nClosing balance under IAS 39 and \\r\\nopening balance under IFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\n199 250 - - 199 250\\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing balance under IAS 39 148 893 - - -\\r\\n\\r\\nRemeasurement (ECL allowances) - - -5 -\\r\\n\\r\\nOpening balance under IFRS 9 - - - 148 888\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing balance under IAS 39 3 221 001 - - -\\r\\n\\r\\nRemeasurement (ECL allowances) - - -13 794 -\\r\\n\\r\\nOpening balance under IFRS 9 - - - 3 207 207\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets measured at \\r\\namortised cost - total\\r\\n\\r\\n3 569 144 - -13 799 3 555 345\\r\\n\\r\\nFair value through profit or loss\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\nprofit or loss\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing balance under IAS 39 and \\r\\nopening balance under IFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\n4 526 - - 4 526\\r\\n\\r\\nDerivatives\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing balance under IAS 39 and \\r\\nopening balance under IFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\n4 161 - - 4 161\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\nprofit or loss - total\\r\\n\\r\\n8 687 - - 8 687\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nFinancial liabilities\\r\\n\\r\\nIAS 39 carrying amount \\r\\n31 December 2017 Reclassifications\\r\\n\\r\\nRemeasurements \\r\\n31 December 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 carrying amount \\r\\n1 January 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nProvisions - - - -\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing balance under IAS 39 \\r\\nand opening balance under \\r\\nIFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\n650 - 372 1 022\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities - total 650 - 372 1 022\\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\\r\\nThe standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model that will \\r\\napply to revenue earned from a contract with a customer (with limited exceptions), regardless of the type of revenue transaction \\r\\nor the industry. The standard’s requirements also apply to the recognition and measurement of gains and losses on the sale of \\r\\nsome non-financial assets that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities (e.g., sales of property, plant and equipment \\r\\nor intangibles). Extensive disclosures will be required, including disaggregation of total revenue; information about performance \\r\\nobligations; changes in contract asset and liability account balances between periods and key judgments and estimates. \\r\\nManagement has assessed that the application of the standard did not have any effect on the Group financial statements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe core principle of IFRS 15 is that revenue must be recognised to reflect the transfer of services to customers at an amount that \\r\\nreflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for such services. This core principle is applied through a \\r\\nfive-step model:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Identify the contract with the customer, \\r\\n2) Identify the performance obligation in the contract,\\r\\n3) Determine the transaction price,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n20\\r\\n\\r\\n4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract,\\r\\n5) Recognise revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor each performance obligation identified, the Group determines at contract inception whether it satisfies the performance \\r\\nobligation over time or at a point in time, and whether the consideration is fixed or variable, including whether consideration is \\r\\nconstrained due to external factors. Consideration is subsequently allocated to the identified performance obligation. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor services provided over time, consideration is recognised when the service is provided to the customer assuming that a \\r\\nsignificant reversal of consideration will not occur. Examples of income earned for services satisfied over time include the fee \\r\\nincome earned for the asset management services. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf a performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time, then the income is recognised when the service is transferred to the \\r\\ncustomer. Examples of such income include fee income for executing transactions (clearing and settlement, customers’ securities \\r\\ntrading, payment cards transaction fees).\\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Clarifications)\\r\\nThe Clarifications apply for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. The objective \\r\\nof the Clarifications is to clarify the IASB’s intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts \\r\\nwith Customers, particularly the accounting of identifying performance obligations amending the wording of the “separately \\r\\nidentifiable” principle, of principal versus agent considerations including the assessment of whether an entity is a principal or \\r\\nan agent as well as applications of control principles and of licensing providing additional guidance for accounting of intellectual \\r\\nproperty and royalties. The Clarifications also provide additional practical expedients for entities that either apply IFRS 15 fully \\r\\nretrospectively or that elect to apply the modified retrospective approach. As described above, management has assessed that \\r\\nthe application of the standard did not have any material effect on the Group financial statements.\\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 Leases\\r\\nIFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases as of January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation \\r\\nand disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet model similar to the \\r\\naccounting for finance leases under IAS 17. The standard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees – leases of ’low-value’ \\r\\nassets (e.g., personal computers) and short-term leases (i.e., leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments (i.e., the lease liability) and an asset \\r\\nrepresenting the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e., the right-of-use asset). Lessees will be required to \\r\\nseparately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset. Lessees \\r\\nwill be also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events (e.g., a change in the lease term, a \\r\\nchange in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments). The lessee will \\r\\ngenerally recognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently the Group is analyzing the operating lease agreements to determine to what extent these will result in the recognition \\r\\nof assets and liabilities. Some of the commitments will be covered by the exception for short term and low value and some \\r\\ncommitments will not qualify as leases under IFRS16. The assessment of the potential effect of IFRS 16 on the financial statements \\r\\nof 2019 is in process. \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 3. RISK MANAGEMENT\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required \\r\\nin the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual financial statements as at 31 \\r\\nDecember 2017. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been no major changes in the risk management or in any risk management policies since year’s end.\\r\\n\\r\\nKey judgments, inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used for assessing expected credit losses.\\r\\nWith the adoption of IFRS 9, a three-stage model was introduced:\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 1 – part of the portfolio for which no significant deterioration in credit quality has occurred since initial recognition (or the \\r\\nexposure is of low credit risk) and the financial instrument is not considered credit-impaired;\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 2 – part of the portfolio for which significant deterioration in credit quality has occurred since initial recognition, evidenced \\r\\nby the SICR – significant increase in credit risk – indicator, and the financial instrument is not considered credit-impaired;\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 3 – credit-impaired part of the portfolio. Luminor equates default and credit-impairment definitions so that all defaulted \\r\\nexposures are treated as credit-impaired and all credit-impaired exposures are treated as defaulted. This approach is based \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n21\\r\\n\\r\\non the fact that the default definition used by the Bank covers all events indicated by IFRS 9 as possible evidence that financial \\r\\ninstrument is credit-impaired and all of these events are considered by Luminor as having a detrimental impact on the estimated \\r\\nfuture cash flows from the instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional category is POCI financial assets - financial assets that were purchased or originated as credit-impaired. POCI assets \\r\\nare subject to unchanging classification, i.e. financial asset once classified as POCI remains in this group until derecognized. The \\r\\nPOCI classification is determined at the financial instrument level.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor applies low credit risk exemption to the following classes of exposures:\\r\\n • central governments,\\r\\n • central bank,\\r\\n • regional governments,\\r\\n • local authorities,\\r\\n • institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe counterparty must fulfil the condition of having a credit rating indicating investment grade.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, the financial asset is treated as facing significant increase in credit risk if at least one of the following SICR indicators is \\r\\nidentified after initial recognition of the financial instrument and was not present as of its origination:\\r\\n\\r\\n • Significant increase of 12-month PD – significant increase of point-in-time (PIT) forward-looking 12-month PD since initial \\r\\nrecognition until reporting date (2.5 times and 0.6 p.p. jointly),\\r\\n\\r\\n • Risk grade 9 or 10 – risk grade 9 or 10 as of reporting date,\\r\\n • 30 days past due – more than 30 days past due as of reporting date,\\r\\n • Forborne performing – forborne performing status as of reporting date (forbearance not triggering non-performing status) \\r\\n\\r\\nin accordance with FINREP instruction reporting requirements,\\r\\n • Watch list – watch list status as of reporting date.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the SICR indicators are recognized at financial instrument level in order to track changes in credit risk since initial recognition \\r\\ndate for a particular financial instrument, even though some of them refer to the customer’s characteristics.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor identifies default when either or both of the following default indicators have taken place: \\r\\n1. The customer is more than 90 days past due on any material obligation to the Bank;\\r\\n2. The customer is considered unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor exposure to banks, the default is recognized when payments are due more than 7 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of identifying unlikelihood of payment,  the elements taken as indications of unlikelihood of payment include the \\r\\nfollowing:\\r\\n\\r\\n • Distressed restructuring of credit obligation (forbearance triggering non-performing status in accordance with FINREP \\r\\ninstruction requirements); \\r\\n\\r\\n • Major financial problems of the customer (present or expected), i.e. significant financial difficulties;\\r\\n • Recognition of specific credit risk adjustment resulting from a significant decline in credit quality of the exposure;\\r\\n • Bankruptcy of the customer or similar protection;\\r\\n • Disappearance of an active market for a financial asset because of the financial difficulties of the customer;\\r\\n • Sell of credit obligation at material credit-related economic loss;\\r\\n • Purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses;\\r\\n • Credit fraud;\\r\\n • External rating indicating default.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe default is recognised at the customer level.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturn to a non-defaulted status is possible not earlier than after 3 months when all default triggers cease to be met. During these \\r\\n3 months of the probation period, the timely payments by the customer should be ensured. The exemption from the general rule \\r\\nof probation is distressed restructuring where at least 1 year needs to pass since the moment that restructuring measures were \\r\\nextended and the moment when a customer is deemed to have an ability to comply with the post-restructuring conditions. This \\r\\napproach is consistent with FINREP instruction requirements for treatment of forborne non-performing exposures.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the shift from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 approach, the incurred loss model was replaced by the expected credit loss (ECL) model. For \\r\\nStage 1 financial assets, loss allowances equal the 12-month ECL while for Stage 2 and Stage 3 financial instruments, lifetime ECL \\r\\nis calculated. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Purchased or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) financial assets, ECL is estimated in the lifetime horizon until the maturity. \\r\\nThe loss expected at initial recognition is referred to as Initial impairment. In subsequent periods, only the cumulative changes in \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n22\\r\\n\\r\\nthe lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition are recognised in profit or loss. Collective assessment of impairment \\r\\nis performed for all financial instruments that are not defaulted as of the reporting date, i.e. are classified as either Stage 1 or \\r\\nStage 2 or are non-defaulted POCI asset. The expected loss is calculated as the probability-weighted average of losses expected \\r\\nin different macroeconomic scenarios. Expected loss in concrete macroeconomic scenario is calculated as the multiple of \\r\\nprobability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and cumulative prepayment rate and is discounted \\r\\nusing the effective interest rate. PD curves, LGD curves and EAD curves are estimated for all months until the maturity date of \\r\\nthe facility. If the facility is classified as Stage 1, expected losses are estimated over the period of up to 12 months. If the facility is \\r\\nclassified as Stage 2, then the expected loss is estimated over the period up to maturity date of the facility.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimation of PD and LGD curves take into account forward-looking macroeconomic information. The methodology of estimation \\r\\nof these risk parameters includes modelling of the relationship between risk parameters and macroeconomic variables. Forecasts \\r\\nof macroeconomic variables under different scenarios for 3 upcoming years together with scenario probabilities are prepared \\r\\nby Luminor macroeconomists. Three macroeconomic scenarios are considered: the baseline/realistic, positive, and pessimistic \\r\\nscenarios (with the probability weights of 60%, 25% and 15% respectively). Macroeconomic scenarios that are prepared for the \\r\\nestimation of expected losses are consistent with scenarios which are used in credit risk stress testing process. Macroeconomic \\r\\nvariables that are included in the modelling are annual change in real GDP, unemployment rate and annual change of residential \\r\\nreal estate price. Starting from the fourth year. it is assumed that risk parameters (PD and LGD) converge to their long-term \\r\\naverage levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stage 3 exposures (or defaulted POCI assets), which are classified as material, Luminor evaluates the impairment amount \\r\\non individual basis (individual assessment) under discounted cash flows (DCF) method. Two scenarios – base case and risk case \\r\\n– are used. For exceptional cases, usage of one scenario can be sufficient. The circumstances when only one scenario might be \\r\\nacceptable could be the deep workout case or the case when total exposure of defaulted borrower falls below the materiality \\r\\nthreshold.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stage 3 exposures (or defaulted POCI assets), which are classified as immaterial, Luminor evaluates the impairment amount \\r\\non collective basis (collective assessment). Impairment is calculated applying the pool rate for the unsecured part. Different pool \\r\\nrates are applied for these pools distinguished by Luminor:\\r\\n\\r\\n • mortgage loans and private credits to private individuals,\\r\\n • consumer loans and other loans to private individuals (including leasing),\\r\\n • SMEs (all financial instruments to legal entities).\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 4. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\\r\\nThe new expected loss approach model had a negative impact on the Bank’s regulatory capital. By  decision of the Board of \\r\\nDirectors of Luminor Group AB, the Bank did not apply transitional arrangements allowed by EU Regulation 2017/2395  and \\r\\nrecognised the full effect of the implementation of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. The capital adequacy ratio is still significantly above \\r\\nthe regulatory minimum and in line with the internal Risk Appetite statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR 30 September 2018 31 December 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nOWN FUNDS\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where the \\r\\nfair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active \\r\\nmarkets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs \\r\\nto these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but where observable market data is not available, \\r\\njudgment is required to establish fair values. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of loans to customers, customer deposits, amounts due from credit institutions and amounts due to credit \\r\\ninstitutions and other financial assets and liabilities, obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows \\r\\nusing rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn assessing the fair value for financial assets, the management has performed discounted cash flow analysis; up-to-date market \\r\\ninformation at the moment of assessment is used for assessing cash flows. For loans, where base interest rates are pegged to \\r\\nfloating market interest rates, the Group has considered the difference between the average interest margin of issued loans \\r\\nand average interest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has not been changed \\r\\n(increased) since issuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal to fair value.\\r\\n\\r\\nFair value of financial liabilities at amortized cost such as Loans and deposits from credit institutions and Deposits from customers \\r\\nwhich are not on demand have been estimated based on discounted cash flow model using interest rates for similar products as \\r\\nat period’s end. Fair value of those financial liabilities that are on demand or have floating interest rate have been estimated to be \\r\\napproximately equal to its carrying amount.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table below summarizes the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair \\r\\nvalue. Financial instruments are distributed by 3 levels of fair value:\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value     measurement is directly \\r\\nor indirectly observable.\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of all Bank contracted derivatives  is defined as level 2. These are interest rate swaps and in all cases pricing is based \\r\\non market observable inputs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no movements of financial instruments between the levels during 2018 and 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nValuation of all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value was performed as at 30 September 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n27\\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\r\\nFair value measurement using\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nDate of \\r\\n\\r\\nvaluation\\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1)\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 2)\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) Total\\r\\n\\r\\nAssets 30.09.2018\\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash balances with central \\r\\nbanks\\r\\n\\r\\n5 369 559 416 0 564 786\\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 0 74 524 0 74 524\\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 3 218 0 3 218\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\nprofit or loss\\r\\n\\r\\n0 4 623 0 4 623\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 0 0 3 294 164 3 294 164\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  5 369 641 782 3 294 164 3 941 315\\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities 30.09.2018\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions\\r\\n\\r\\n0 1 611 954 0 1 611 954\\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 1 776 620 0 1 776 620\\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 0 65 167 65 167\\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 3 218 0 3 218\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  0 3 391 792 65 167 3 456 960\\r\\n\\r\\n Fair value measurement using\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nDate of \\r\\n\\r\\nvaluation\\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1)\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs  (Level 2)\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs        \\r\\n(Level 3) Total\\r\\n\\r\\nAssets 31 December 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash balances with central \\r\\nbanks\\r\\n\\r\\n0 0 199 250 199 250\\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions \\r\\n(demand) \\r\\n\\r\\n0 0 92 832 92 832\\r\\n\\r\\nReceivables from parent pledged as \\r\\ncollateral\\r\\n\\r\\n0 0 37 647 37 647\\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 4 161 0 4 161\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\nprofit or loss\\r\\n\\r\\n0 4 526 0 4 526\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 0 0 3 239 414 3 239 414\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  0 8 687 3 569 143 3 577 830\\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities 31 December 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions\\r\\n\\r\\n0 0 1 397 509 1 397 509\\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 0 1 648 598 1 648 598\\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 0 65 007 65 007\\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 4 161 0 4 161\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 0 0 3 111 114 3 115 275\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n28\\r\\n\\r\\nDemand deposits due from credit institutions and loans and receivables to customers are issued on market conditions. Therefore, \\r\\nthe fair value of these financial assets does not materially differ from their carrying amount as at 30 September 2018 and 31 \\r\\nDecember 2017. The rates for the financial instruments are mostly floating. In determining the fair value of loans and receivables \\r\\nto customers, management judgements are used. Loans and receivables from customers are thus categorised under hierarchy \\r\\nlevel 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement for liabilities is based on the calculation using non-observable inputs thus the same categorization as for \\r\\nassets should be applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 16.

SEGMENT REPORTING\\r\\n\\r\\nMeasurement of performance of operating segments\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM), as required by IFRS 8. At Luminor, the CODM has been defined as Group Executive Management. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Executive Management Committee monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making \\r\\ndecisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profits \\r\\nor losses and is measured consistently with operating profits or losses in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income \\r\\nis reported net as management primarily relies on net interest revenue as a performance measure, along with the gross income \\r\\nand expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 October 2017, Luminor Group implemented new reportable operating segments, and therefore there is no comparable \\r\\ndata with respective segmentation for previous periods. \\r\\n\\r\\nBasis of segmentation\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the four main business areas: Corporate Banking, Business Clients, Household and Private \\r\\nBanking. Other operating segments below the quantitative thresholds in IFRS 8 and that are not completely allocated are included \\r\\nin the Other segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nReportable Operating Segments\\r\\nCorporate Banking service large corporate customers and Business  service small and medium-sized corporate customers. \\r\\nCorporate & Business Banking works with a relationship-driven customer service model with a customer-centric value proposition \\r\\nfor Luminor’s corporate customers. The Household segment serves Luminor’s household customers in the Baltic markets, through \\r\\nvarious channels offering a full range of financial services and solutions. The business area includes advisory and service staff, \\r\\nchannels, product units, back office and IT under a common strategy, operating model and governance across markets. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n30\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking provides high-quality investment, savings and risk management products. It also manages customers’ assets and \\r\\ngives financial advice to affluent and high net worth individuals as well as to institutional investors. The Other segment includes \\r\\nresults not fully allocated to any of the operating segments.\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\n01 January 2018 to 30 September 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate \\r\\nBanking\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness \\r\\nclients Household\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate \\r\\nBanking Other Total\\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 13 448 6 355 11 045 912 21 446 53 206\\r\\n\\r\\nNet fees & commission income 3 071 1 136 3 364 252 3 921 11 744\\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income 1 034 291 391 80 1 045 2 841\\r\\n\\r\\nOther income 92 144 17 0 2 210 2 463\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal income 17 645 7 926 14 817 1 244 28 623 70 255\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel costs, administrative costs \\r\\nand depreciation \\r\\n\\r\\n-7 395 -4 269 -13 773 -781 -19 437 -45 655\\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (losses/ reversal) 4 963 -4 303 3 811 13 -2 935 1 549\\r\\n\\r\\nOther 0 0 0 0 -1 674 -1 674\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating profit 15 213 -646 4 855 476 4 577 24 475\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nQ3 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate \\r\\nBanking\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness \\r\\nclients Household\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate \\r\\nBanking Other Total\\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 6 798 3 262 5 733 427 1 421 17 641\\r\\n\\r\\nNet fees & commission income 1 543 655 1 797 121 -35 4 081\\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income 787 110 152 98 -58 1 089\\r\\n\\r\\nOther income 72 0 13 0 -402 -317\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal income 9 200 4 027 7 695 646 925 22 493\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel costs, administrative costs \\r\\nand depreciation \\r\\n\\r\\n-3 328 -1 715 -6 087 -398 -1 219 -12 747\\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (losses/ reversal) -2 380 383 -781 -44 7 -2 815\\r\\n\\r\\nOther 0 0 0 0 149 149\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating profit 3 492 2 695 827 204 -137 7 081\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\n30 September 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate \\r\\nBanking\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness \\r\\nclients Household\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate \\r\\nBanking Other Total\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 1 391 087 503 885 1 394 673 37 195 0 3 326 840\\r\\n\\r\\nOther assets 637 491 637 491\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal assets 1 391 087 503 885 1 394 673 37 195 637 491 3 964 331\\r\\n \\r\\nDeposits from customers 813 229 286 297 369 456 230 634 0 1 699 616\\r\\n\\r\\nOther liabilities 1 792 177 1 792 177\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal liabilities 813 229 286 297 369 456 230 634 1 792 177 3 491 793\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 18. TAX\\r\\nStarting from 1 April 2018, the quarterly profits of credit institutions are subject to corporate income tax at the rate of 14%. The \\r\\ntax is payable by the 10th day of the third month of the following quarter. Once the profits are distributed, an additional income \\r\\ntax of up to 6% is further payable, which adds up to the total tax rate of up to 20%. The rate of the additional tax depends on the \\r\\nregularity of the dividend payments. If no dividends are paid, the advance tax payments are not refunded.  Advance income tax \\r\\nwas first time applied to the bank’s profit for 2018 Q2 in the amount of 1 144 thousand euros. In Q3, the advance income tax was \\r\\nrecognized in the amount of 360 thousand euros.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n31\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 19.

Total shareholder equity of Luminor amounts to 1.8 billion euros \\r\\nand is capitalized at CET1 18%. Luminor’s vision is to become the best financial ecosystem for its customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, an agreement was signed between DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank AB with US-based private equity \\r\\nfirm Blackstone to sell the majority stake in Luminor. As part of the transaction, Blackstone will acquire a 60% majority stake \\r\\nin the bank. Nordea and DNB will retain equal 20% equity stakes in Luminor and will continue to support the bank with long \\r\\nterm funding, expertise and ongoing representation on the Board of Directors. Additionally, Blackstone has entered into an \\r\\nagreement with Nordea to purchase their remaining 20% stake over the coming years. Closing of the transaction is subject \\r\\nto European Central Bank’s and local supervisory authorities’ approvals and is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis transaction represents the largest majority-stake acquisition of a universal bank by private equity in the last decade \\r\\nglobally, and one of the largest M&A transactions in Baltic history. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (or “Luminor Estonia”) offers a wide range of products and services to its customers in all channels, digital \\r\\nand physical, with 10 offices including headquarter in Tallinn and customer service centers in Tartu, Pärnu, Viljandi, Rakvere \\r\\nand Jõhvi, in addition a cashless advisory desk in Kuressaare. Luminor has a total of 100 ATMs throughout Estonia.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of Q4 2018, Luminor Estonia employed 671 full-time employees and served ca 138,000 clients in the private and \\r\\nbusiness segments, with a market share of 16% in lending and 10% in deposits, making it the third largest financial service \\r\\nprovider on the market. Luminor Estonia’s capital ratio at the end of Q4 2018 was 18.80%. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Estonia has five subsidiaries: Luminor Liising AS, which provides leasing for vehicles, heavy equipment and other \\r\\nassets; Luminor Pensions Estonia AS, which focuses on growing the pension assets of clients; Luminor Kindlustusmaakler \\r\\nOÜ, which provides insurance broker services; and Promano OÜ and Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ, which provide asset management \\r\\nservices. \\r\\n\\r\\nMoody’s has assigned long- and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, as well as a local \\r\\ncurrency long-term (P)Baa2 senior MTN rating to Luminor Bank AS. \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview \\r\\nDespite all the macro headwinds and challenges emanating from the external sector including trade tensions and slowing \\r\\nglobal trade, 2018 was still overall a rather good growth year for Estonia. Estonia's open economy is highly integrated with \\r\\nthe economies of the Euro area and the Nordic countries and has developed hand in hand with them, supported by strong \\r\\nlabour markets. As expected, economic momentum did only marginally moderate last year from a robust 4.9% y/y pace in \\r\\n2017 to 3.8% y/y (Q1-Q3 18). As a key positive development, export revenues picked up speed as from Q2 following a weak \\r\\nstart of the year, and remained on the modest growth trend at year-end. However, the key drag to GDP growth resulted \\r\\nfrom investments with growth affected last but not least by last year’s strong base (one-off large investment transactions) \\r\\nand elevated uncertainty in the external environment.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n4 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of industry branches, the contributions to decent Q3 growth (4.2% y/y) were the strongest by construction and \\r\\nexport-orientated manufacturing sector, followed by science and technology plus the pivotal ICT branches. Expectedly, \\r\\nconsumers appetite remained rather elevated on the back of strong labour markets with somewhat softer demand for large \\r\\nticket items at year end (confirming moderation in the housing market activity). The consumers have not really opted for \\r\\nopening the purses to spend the extra boost received from the past taxation reform (which effectively increased the non-\\r\\ntaxable income). As a positive development inflation has expectedly trended lower with waning pressure from energy prices, \\r\\nwhich is expected further to exert downward price pressure in H1 2019. Overall, Estonia’s underlying growth is expected to \\r\\ncontinue broad-based with risks in the external sector pointing towards gradual moderation of current strong growth trend. \\r\\nIn comparison with the euro-area average the deceleration of growth in Estonia has remained limited with cyclical indicators \\r\\nin domestic and external sectors (including economic and consumer confidence) pointing to only soft moderation ahead.  \\r\\n\\r\\nActivities \\r\\nIn Q4 2018, Luminor continued with the finalization of the legal aspects of its merger, which will see the full integration of \\r\\nthe banks, continuing operations in all three Baltic states through the Estonian bank and its registered branches in Latvia \\r\\nand Lithuania. In May 2018, Luminor received confirmation from the European Central Bank that the branches in Latvia and \\r\\nLithuania could be established and commence operations. Starting from 2 January 2019 Luminor continues its operations \\r\\nas one integrated pan-Baltic bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nHOUSEHOLD SEGMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of Q4 2018, Luminor Estonia had approximately 116,000 household clients. In Q4 2018 Luminor Estonia focused \\r\\non increasing volumes of saving and investment products through educating and advising our customers. Dedicated team \\r\\nof advisors were established and trained in order to give the best professional saving and investment advice to the \\r\\ncustomers.  As a result, in Q4 2018 household segment customers deposits in Luminor Estonia increased by 2.7%.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal lending average volume remained stable. In Q4 2018 new housing loan volumes were decreasing compared to Q3 2018, \\r\\nwhereas new housing loan average margin has increased. In December 2018 Luminor Estonia started with external Consumer \\r\\nlending campaign in order to help the customers to cover unforeseeable expenses or to pay for larger purchases. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s goal is to become the home bank for the target customers by offering professional advice and excellent customer \\r\\nservice. Delivering good customer experiences and meeting our customers’ needs are essential to Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nPRIVATE BANKING SEGMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking customer activities are centered on everyday banking and growing the savings portfolio. We help high net \\r\\nworth individuals and their families to grow, manage and preserve their wealth. By the end of Q4 2018, Luminor Estonia had \\r\\naround 1,000 Private Banking customers. In Q4 2018, Private Banking focused on strategic positioning and attracting new \\r\\nfunding through collaboration with Luminor’s other business segments and marketing to help deliver results.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBUSINESS AND CORPORATE CLIENT SEGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Q4 2018, Luminor Estonia continued to serve its ca 21,000 customers in the corporate and business client segments. \\r\\nLuminor Estonia continued profitable lending growth to small and medium-sized business clients. Our activities towards \\r\\nbusiness clients were supported by sales campaign that focused attracting new customers. In the year end Luminor Estonia \\r\\ntogether with Eesti Meedia AS and Regional Development Centers started an Entrepreneurial Courage Award to recognize \\r\\nstrong local and regional companies who have made a remarkable change in their business.  \\r\\n\\r\\nQ4 corporate client segment results were in line with macroeconomic developments. Lending to large corporations and \\r\\ninternational customers had a positive impact in lending profitability and deposit balance. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n5 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOur corporate customers value our tailored financial products and relationship banking concept. In Q4 2018 special focus \\r\\nwas given to diversify customer portfolios and deposit book and to double check our AML internal routines towards \\r\\ncorporate customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 December 2018 Private Banking and corporate client segment invited its customers to hear about insights on \\r\\nupcoming macroeconomic and foreign policy trends. \\r\\n\\r\\nLEASING \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing services for vehicles, heavy equipment and other assets for private individuals and business clients are provided \\r\\nthrough the subsidiary Luminor Liising AS. End of Q4 2018, the total leasing portfolio amounted to 937 million euros and new \\r\\nfinancing volume in last quarter was 68 million euros. About 50% of new financing was granted to passenger cars which is \\r\\nbiggest single asset group in leasing portfolio. \\r\\n\\r\\nPENSIONS \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Q4 2018 Luminor Estonia continued to provide 2nd and 3rd pillar and employer pension fund management services to its \\r\\ncustomers through its subsidiary Luminor Pensions Estonia AS.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Pensions increased its investments in activities that brought the information of pension funds and funds closer to \\r\\nthe client. Global capital markets fell in Q4 2018 and had a negative impact on pension fund short-term results. By the end \\r\\nof Q4 2018, assets under management had reached 317 million euros, a minor decrease compared to previous quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, Luminor's long-term performance of Estonian pension funds is among the best in the market in both \\r\\nsecond and third pillar funds. In Q4 2018 the customer portfolio had a healthy growth and reached to 51,000 customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN LUMINOR \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are creating a new-generation financial services provider because we are determined to build a better tomorrow – for \\r\\nfamilies and businesses and for the communities and countries in which we live and operate.

Focusing \\r\\non serving the Baltic customers we continuously aim for a full transparency in customers background, availability of KYC \\r\\ndata and economic rational in activities. At Luminor, we have zero tolerance towards money laundering and other financial \\r\\ncrime risk. Luminor has developed and implemented a comprehensive set of measures to identify, manage and control its \\r\\nrisks. We comply with sanctions laws and follow the guidelines, recommendations and standards issued by local regulatory \\r\\nand supervisory authorities and relevant international organizations, as well as those issued by local banking associations \\r\\nand financial intelligence units in each Baltic state. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur Compliance and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) functions are operating at the pan-Baltic level, having competence \\r\\ncenters   and highly experienced professionals in the following areas: data protection, AML/ Certified Fraud Examiners (CFT), \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n6 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFATCA, IT compliance and digital channels, business integrity, bank products and new product development. Luminor’s \\r\\nAML, Compliance and Anti-Financial Crime units employs over 100 professionals, maintaining a robust compliance \\r\\nframework and processes through the organization. \\r\\n\\r\\nSIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER 31 DECEMBER 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries \\r\\nthrough the Estonian registered bank and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all assets, \\r\\nrights and liabilities of Luminor Latvia and Luminor Lithuania were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank will \\r\\ncontinue the same activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 2019 Luminor will be simplifying its operating model and reducing its staff numbers from the current ca 3000 \\r\\nemployees, at all levels (including management), comprising around 130 employees in Estonia, 250 employees in Latvia and \\r\\n420 employees in Lithuania. \\r\\n\\r\\nStarting from 2 January 2019, the deposits and financial instruments of the depositors and investment services clients of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Latvian branch and Luminor Bank AS Lithuanian branch will be guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and \\r\\ninvestor protection scheme established and operated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new simplified structure and governance model enables the bank faster decision making, provides excellent cross-\\r\\nborder collaboration opportunities and improves efficiency. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2 January 2019, after completion of the merger, Luminor has a new organizational set up, a new governance structure \\r\\nand new members of management bodies. Erkki Raasuke will continue as Luminor ’s CEO and Nils Melngailis will be chairing \\r\\nthe supervisory board.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new governance structure of Luminor: \\r\\n\\r\\nSupervisory Council of Luminor Bank AS \\r\\n\\r\\n• Nils Melngailis, Chairman of the Council \\r\\n• Bjørn Erik Naess, Member of the Council  \\r\\n• Jörgen Christian Andersen, Member of the Council \\r\\n• Michael Jackson, Member of the Council \\r\\n• Trygve Young, Member of the Council \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nOn 23 January 2019 two additional council members, were appointed to Luminor—Ari Kaperi and Nadine Faruque. \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement Board of Luminor Bank AS \\r\\n\\r\\n• Erkki Raasuke, Chairman of the Management Board \\r\\n• Christian Wallentin, Member of the Management Board, CFO, Head of Financial division \\r\\n• Kristina Siimar, Member of the Management Board, Head of Products and Offerings \\r\\n• Kerli Gabrilovica, Member of the Management Board, Head of Luminor Latvian branch \\r\\n• Andrius Načajus, Member of the Management Board, Head of Luminor Lithuanian branch \\r\\n• Hannu Saksala, Member of the Management Board, Head of Risk division \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nOn 31 January 2019 Christian Wallentin, CFO and Head of Financial division has resigned from his position and management \\r\\nboard, to pursue other interests. Following Wallentins resignation, Tina Kukka Head of Transformation Management Office, \\r\\nwill assume the role of interim CFO and lead the financial division along with her current duties. New CFO will be appointed \\r\\nsoon.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n7 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe permanent Supervisory Council committees which were previously established for each Baltic country separately are \\r\\ngoing forward and operating as single committees on a group level, comprising Audit Committee, Risk Committee, \\r\\nNomination Committee and Remuneration Committee.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter completing the cross-border merger, Luminor has taken steps to re-organize its operating model.  On 7 January 2019 \\r\\nLuminor has decided to proceed with the next phase of transformation, including changing operating model. The bank aims \\r\\nto transform its operating model by simplifying its structure and decision process, unifying and executing IT consolidation, \\r\\nstrengthening its controls, and becoming more efficient, more resilient and more resolvable.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is customer-driven organization and our operating model is built to support regional scale, business development \\r\\nand efficiency, but also high relevance in customer intimacy. With the adjusted operating model, Luminor expects to \\r\\nsignificantly reduce the operating expenses and create the capacity to invest for the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Results \\r\\nThe merger of the Baltic businesses of DNB and Nordea in October 2017 has had a significant impact both on the financial \\r\\nresult and operational focus. The consolidated financial information prior to the merger represents consolidated results of \\r\\nDNB’s respective entities, whereas starting from 1 October 2017, such financial information also reflects the effects of the \\r\\nacquisition of assets and liabilities of Nordea. As a result, comparability of consolidated financial information between \\r\\nJanuary-December 2017 and January-December 2018 is limited in light of the effects of the merger. \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit earned in Q4 2018 was 0.6 million euros, which was 6.5 million euros less than Q3 2018 mainly due to tax on \\r\\ndividends recorded in Q4 2018. Net interest margin was 1.7%. Net total operating income increased 3% in Q4 2018 compared \\r\\nto Q3 2018, while total operating expenses increased 51% in the same period, driven by higher IT development costs. \\r\\n\\r\\nKEY FIGURES* \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR Jan-Dec 2018 Q4 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit 25 095  620 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity 468 377 473 530 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE), % 5.4 1.3 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets 3 828 926 4 012 451 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA), % 0.7 0.1 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 69 957  16 752 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage Interest Earning Assets 3 794 325 3 976 956 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM), % 1.8 1.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio (C/I), % 69.4 82.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n* Quarterly ratios and Jan-Dec 2018 ratios (ROE, ROA, NIM, C/I) have been expressed on an annualized basis. \\r\\n \\r\\nExplanations  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity (belonging to owners of company) = (equity at end of reporting period + equity at end of previous period) / 2 \\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) = Net profit / Average equity * 100%  \\r\\nAverage assets = (assets at end of reporting period + assets at end of previous period) / 2  \\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) = Net profit / Assets, average * 100  \\r\\nAverage interest earning assets = (interest-earning assets at end of reporting period + interest-earning assets at end of previous period) / 2 \\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) = Net interest income / Interest earning assets, average * 100 \\r\\nCost / Income ratio = Total operating expenses / Total net income * 100 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n8 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers decreased 1% compared to 30 September 2018 to 3.2 billion euros at 31 December 2018. Loans to non-\\r\\nfinancial corporate customers comprised 51% and loans to households 45% of the credit portfolio of Luminor. The market \\r\\nshare of Luminor’s loans in Estonia was approximately 16%. \\r\\n\\r\\nLending Deposits \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers (excluding deposits from credit institutions) totalled 1.7 billion euros at 31 December 2018, \\r\\ndecreasing 3% from 30 September 2018. Deposits from non-financial corporate clients comprised 49% and deposits from \\r\\nhouseholds 29% of the customer deposit portfolio of Luminor. The market share of Luminor’s deposits in Estonia was \\r\\napproximately 10%. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe loan-to-deposit ratio increased in Q4 2018 to 189% from 185% in Q3.  \\r\\n\\r\\nASSET QUALITY FOR Q4 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe credit quality of the Luminor Estonia lending portfolio as at the end of Q4 2018 has slightly improved. At the end of \\r\\nDecember 2018 allowances for on-balance expected credit losses were calculated as 34 million euros, i.e. approximately \\r\\n1.1% of the Luminor Estonia’s loan portfolio. Decrease in the amount and share of allowances is related mostly to the \\r\\ndecreased loan portfolio volume, however, in some particular client segments increase in the allowances has taken place. \\r\\nThe share of impaired loans in total loan portfolio has slightly decreased and amounts to 3.4%, what is mostly caused by \\r\\nimprovement of the large customers performance. \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR Household Non-financial \\r\\ncorporations \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial \\r\\ncorporations \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral \\r\\ngovernments \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal* \\r\\n\\r\\nGross Loans 1 447 887 1 673 532 39 868 85 854 3 248 141 \\r\\n\\r\\nAllowances -7 095 -27 133 -117 -9 -34 354 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet Loans 1 440 792 1 646 399 39 751 85 845 3 212 787 \\r\\n\\r\\nGross Impaired Loans 21 183 89 223 0 0 110 406 \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment ratio % 0.49% 1.62% 0.29% 0.01% 1.06% \\r\\n\\r\\nGross impaired Loans vs Gross Loans  \\r\\n(NPL ratio) % 1.46%\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n5.33%\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n0.00%\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n0.00%\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n3.40%\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAllowances vs Gross impaired Loans % 33.49% 30.41% N/A N/A 31.12% \\r\\n\\r\\n* excluding Loans to Credit Institutions \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n9 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nExplanations: \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment ratio % = Allowances / Gross Loans \\r\\nGross impaired loans vs Gross Loans (NPL ratio) % = Gross impaired Loans / Gross Loans  \\r\\nAllowances vs Impaired Loans = Allowances(Provisions)/ Gross Impaired Loans \\r\\n\\r\\nFUNDING \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Estonia has a strong and prudent liquidity risk profile. The funding base consists of a large deposit base, issued \\r\\ndebt securities and funding from parent banks, among other items. The funding base is mainly euro-denominated. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor Estonia a Senior Unsecured Medium-Term Note Program rating of Baa2. The \\r\\nassignment of rating was followed by a 350 million senior unsecured inaugural public bond issue with a maturity of 3 years \\r\\nand coupon of 1.50%. The bond is listed on the Euronext Dublin Stock Exchange. Despite the market turbulence at the time \\r\\nof issuance, Luminor was able to attract investors around Europe supported by strong local demand. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of Q4 2014, Luminor Estonia had utilised 1.25 billion euros in funding from the parent banks. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nUtilized parent funding amounts to 3.71 billion euros at the Luminor group level and is provided by the two parent banks in the \\r\\nform of a syndicate, where each parent bank provides 50%. Long-term funding was committed for 6 years (4+2), beginning \\r\\nfrom the 1 October 2017 when Luminor was established and short-term funding in the form of revolving credit of 364 days. \\r\\nIn addition to the current outstanding utilized funding, there is also a committed credit line of 0.9 billion euros in place (not \\r\\nutilized at present). When Luminor attracts wholesale long-term (longer than one year) funding externally, the intent is to \\r\\namortize an equal amount of parent funding. \\r\\n\\r\\nRating \\r\\n\\r\\nMoody’s Investors Service has assigned to Luminor Bank AS (Luminor Estonia) foreign and local currency long- and short-\\r\\nterm deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, as well as a long-term Baa2 senior MTN credit rating. On 11 October 2018, Moody’s \\r\\nconfirmed the local currency long-term senior unsecured debt rating of Baa2 to Luminor Bank AS (Estonia) prior to the EMTN \\r\\nissuance. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2 January 2019 Luminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) are branches of Luminor Bank AS (Estonia). \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n10 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY \\r\\n\\r\\nThe LCR (liquidity coverage ratio) for Luminor Estonia was 238.0% at the end of Q4 2018, according to the Delegated Act’s \\r\\nLCR definition. The liquidity buffer is composed of highly liquid central bank eligible securities and cash. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of Q4 2018, Luminor Estonia’s NSFR (net stable funding ratio) was 112.0% using an RSF (required stable funding) \\r\\nfactor of 85% for qualifying collateralised mortgages. \\r\\n\\r\\nRatio 31 Dec 2018 30 Sep 2018 30 Jun 2018 30 Mar 2018 31 Dec 2017 \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 238.0% 162.9% 160.7% 133.3% 112.0% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR** 112.0% 111.3% 108.4% 100.5% 102.0% \\r\\n\\r\\n**mortgages that would qualify for 35% or lower risk weight are calculated with 85% RSF factor. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nDeposits from customers are mainly from residents of Estonia. In total, 99.0% of all deposits from household and non-\\r\\nfinancial corporates are from EU residents. \\r\\n\\r\\nCAPITAL \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Estonia’s capital adequacy ratio reached 18.80% by 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: 17.69%), which is well \\r\\nabove the internal target of 17.0% and the applicable regulatory requirements. Capital adequacy increased as a result of the \\r\\ndecrease of total risk exposure amount for the period ended on 31 December 2018.

\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL \\r\\nSTATEMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS is a local credit institution whose sole owner is Luminor Group AB and ultimate owners, parents are Nordea \\r\\nBank AB, DNB Bank ASA and Luminor MiCom AB. The Luminor Bank’s registered legal address is Liivalaia 45, 10145,  Tallinn, \\r\\nEstonian Republic. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 1st, 2017 Nordea Bank AB (Swedish company registration No 516406-0120) and DNB Bank ASA (Org. No. 984 851 \\r\\n006) after all regulatory approvals and competition clearance were received, have combined their Baltic business into a \\r\\njointly owned bank, Luminor. By business transfer Nordea Bank AB Lithuania branch, Nordea Bank AB Latvia branch and \\r\\nNordea Bank AB Estonia branch assets and liabilities, including shares of leasing, pension and distressed assets companies \\r\\nin Baltics were transferred to Luminor Bank AB (prev. AB DNB bankas), Luminor Bank AS in Latvia (prev. DNB banka AS) and \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS in Estonia (prev. Aktsiaselts DNB Pank). \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018 an internal corporate restructuring of Luminor Group has been taken place with an aim to concentrate the entire \\r\\nBaltic businesses of Luminor Group in Luminor Bank AS, a credit institution in Estonia; where Luminor Bank AS in Estonia \\r\\nremains as the acquiring entity while Luminor Bank AB in Lithuania and Luminor Bank AS in Latvia are merged into Luminor \\r\\nBank AS in Estonia and cease to exist. A cross border merger is pursued under Directive (EU) 2017/1132 of the European \\r\\nParliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 relating to certain aspects of company law as implemented in Lithuania, Latvia \\r\\nand Estonia respectively. All assets and liabilities of the respective subsidiaries are, in accordance with the relevant laws, \\r\\ntransferred into the Luminor Bank AS in Estonia as a matter of universal succession, and each subsidiary ceased to exist as \\r\\na legal entity upon registration of the cross-border merger.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries \\r\\nthrough the Estonian registered bank and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all assets, \\r\\nrights and liabilities of Luminor Latvia and Luminor Lithuania were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank will \\r\\ncontinue the same activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current annual report, “Bank” (or Luminor Bank AS) refers to Luminor Bank AS. “Group” refers to the consolidated \\r\\nfinancial statements of Luminor Bank AS and its subsidiaries.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 December 2018 Bank owned following subsidiaries: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Liising AS  (leasing and factoring activities), \\r\\n• Luminor Pensions Estonia AS  (management of funds), \\r\\n• Promano Est OÜ (real estate managment), \\r\\n• Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ (real estate management), \\r\\n• Luminor Kindlustusmaakler OÜ ( insurance brokerage). \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 December 2018 the Bank owned 100%  of the share capital of all subsidiaries. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n18 \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (the Bank or the Group) was prepared in accordance with \\r\\nIAS 34 Interim Financial reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed interim financial information does not \\r\\ncontain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction \\r\\nwith the Group’s annual financial statements as at 31 December 2017. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed interim financial information are consistent with those \\r\\nfollowed in the preparation of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, except for the \\r\\naccounting policy of Hedge Accounting and the new accounting standards which came into force from 1 January 2018 and \\r\\nare described below. \\r\\n\\r\\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nHedge Accounting \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which it \\r\\nwishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged \\r\\nand how the Group will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the \\r\\nanalysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for \\r\\nhedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• There is ‘an economic relationship’ between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.  \\r\\n• The effect of credit risk does not ‘dominate the value changes’ that result from that economic relationship.  \\r\\n• The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the \\r\\n\\r\\nGroup actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity \\r\\nof hedged item.  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Group applies fair value hedge. Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized \\r\\nasset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. The change in the fair \\r\\nvalue of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is \\r\\nalso recognized in the statement of profit or loss.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortized cost, any adjustment to carrying value is amortized through \\r\\nprofit or loss over the remaining term of the hedge using the effective interest (EIR) method. The EIR amortization may begin \\r\\nas soon as an adjustment exists and no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value \\r\\nattributable to the risk being hedged.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the hedged item is derecognized, the unamortized fair value is recognized immediately in profit or loss. When an \\r\\nunrecognized firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the \\r\\nfirm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognized as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss \\r\\nrecognized in profit or loss. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n19 \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 9 as issued by the IASB in July 2014 with a date of adoption of 1 January 2018, which resulted \\r\\nin changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. The \\r\\nGroup did not early-adopt IFRS 9 in previous periods. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group elected not to restate comparative figures. Any adjustment \\r\\nto the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained \\r\\nearnings of the current period. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in the changes in accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement \\r\\nof financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets.  \\r\\n\\r\\nClassification and measurement \\r\\n\\r\\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component (determined \\r\\nin accordance with IFRS 15) at their transaction price. Other financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at initial \\r\\nrecognition at their fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit \\r\\nor loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability. \\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent measurement of the financial assets depends on the classification performed by the Group at initial recognition. \\r\\nAt initial recognition, financial assets can be classified into one of the following categories: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, \\r\\n• Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), \\r\\n• Financial assets measured at amortised cost. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nClassification is performed based on both the Group’s business model for managing financial assets and the characteristics \\r\\nof contractual cash flows of the financial assets. However, financial assets that meet the amortised cost or fair value through \\r\\nother comprehensive income measurement criteria, may be designated on initial recognition by the Group to fair value \\r\\nthrough profit or loss measurement option, provided that particular qualifying criteria are met. Additionally, the Group may \\r\\nmake an irrevocable election at initial recognition for particular investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be \\r\\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified into one of the following categories: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, \\r\\n• Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nA financial liability is classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss if: \\r\\n\\r\\n• It meets the definition of “held for trading” and \\r\\n• It is designated upon initial recognition to fair value through the profit or loss measurement option. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nAll other financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost. \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment of financial assets \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 fundamentally changed the credit loss recognition methodology. The standard replaced IAS 39’s incurred loss \\r\\napproach with a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. The Bank is required to recognize an allowance for \\r\\nexpected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n20 \\r\\n\\r\\nguarantee contracts. The allowance is based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default in the \\r\\nnext twelve months unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance \\r\\nis based on the probability of default over the life of the asset. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are \\r\\ncalculated also for purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) regardless of the changes in credit risk during the \\r\\nlifetime of an instrument. The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment at the end of each reporting period \\r\\nof whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by considering the change in the risk of default \\r\\noccurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe assets to test for impairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 \\r\\nincludes assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk or which are classified as low risk (rating \\r\\ncategorised as “Investment grade” or higher), stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit \\r\\nrisk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets. Significant assets in stage 3 are tested for impairment on an individual basis, while \\r\\nfor insignificant assets a collective assessment is performed. In stage 1, the allowances equal the 12-month expected credit \\r\\nloss. In stage 2 and 3, the allowances equal the lifetime expected credit losses.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOne important driver for size of allowances under IFRS 9 is the trigger for transferring an asset from Stage 1 to Stage 2. The \\r\\nBank has decided to use a mix of absolute and relative changes (0.6 p.p. and 2.5 times) in 12-month point-in-time Probability \\r\\nof Default (PD) to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. In addition, customers with \\r\\nforbearance measures, included on the watch list and contracts with payments more than thirty days past due are also \\r\\ntransferred to Stage 2. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe agreed IFRS 9 impairment methodology is documented in internal procedures and applied in daily life. Integration into \\r\\nfront office business processes follows and is intended to be finalized during the year 2018, but this does not impact \\r\\nimpairment calculation. In general, IFRS 9 impairment model results in earlier recognition of credit losses for the respective \\r\\nitems and increases the amount of loss allowances recognised for these items. Moreover, the impairment calculations under \\r\\nIFRS 9 are more volatile and pro-cyclical than under IAS 39, mainly due to the significant subjectivity applied in the forward-\\r\\nlooking scenarios. IFRS 9 impairment requirements are applied retrospectively, with transition impact recognized in retained \\r\\nearnings at 1 January 2018.  \\r\\n\\r\\nImpact of the adoption of IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nSet out below are disclosures relating to the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nClassification and measurement of financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement category and the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 and IFRS 9 \\r\\nas at January 2018 are compared as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets \\r\\nT EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal measurement \\r\\ncategory under IAS 39 \\r\\n\\r\\nNew measurement \\r\\ncategory under IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nIAS 39 carrying \\r\\namount 31 Dec 2017 \\r\\n\\r\\nNew carrying amount \\r\\nunder IFRS 9 1 Jan 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with \\r\\ncentral banks \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables Amortised cost 199 250 199 250 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables Amortised cost 148 893 148 888 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair \\r\\nvalue through profit or \\r\\nloss \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at FVTPL  Financial assets at \\r\\nFVTPL  \\r\\n\\r\\n4 526 4 526 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivatives Fair value through profit \\r\\nor loss \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value through \\r\\nprofit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\n4 161 iu2 144 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables Loans and receivables Amortised cost 3 221 001 3 210 268 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n21 \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no changes for classification and measurement of financial liabilities.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities \\r\\nT EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal measurement \\r\\ncategory under IAS 39 \\r\\n\\r\\nNew measurement \\r\\ncategory under IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nIAS 39 carrying amount  \\r\\n31 Dec 2017 \\r\\n\\r\\nNew carrying amount \\r\\nunder IFRS 9 1 Jan 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivatives Fair value through profit or loss \\r\\nFair value through profit \\r\\nor loss 4 161 3 310 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nReconciliation of impairment allowance balance from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table reconciles the prior period’s closing impairment allowance measured in accordance with the IAS 39 \\r\\nincurred loss model to the new impairment allowance measured in accordance with the IFRS 9 expected loss model as at 1 \\r\\nJanuary 2018: \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets \\r\\nT EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nLoss allowance under IAS \\r\\n39/Provision under IAS 37 Reclassifications Remeasurements \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit loss allowance \\r\\nunder IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nAmortised cost         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with \\r\\ncentral banks -

The standard’s requirements also apply to the recognition and measurement of gains and losses \\r\\non the sale of some non-financial assets that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities (e.g., sales of property, \\r\\nplant and equipment or intangibles). Extensive disclosures will be required, including disaggregation of total revenue; \\r\\ninformation about performance obligations; changes in contract asset and liability account balances between periods and \\r\\nkey judgments and estimates. Management has assessed that the application of the standard did not have any effect on the \\r\\nGroup financial statements.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe core principle of IFRS 15 is that revenue must be recognised to reflect the transfer of services to customers at an \\r\\namount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for such services. This core principle is \\r\\napplied through a five-step model: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. Identify the contract with the customer,  \\r\\n\\r\\n2. Identify the performance obligation in the contract, \\r\\n\\r\\n3. Determine the transaction price, \\r\\n\\r\\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract, \\r\\n\\r\\n5. Recognise revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n23 \\r\\n\\r\\nFor each performance obligation identified, the Group determines at contract inception whether it satisfies the \\r\\nperformance obligation over time or at a point in time, and whether the consideration is fixed or variable, including whether \\r\\nconsideration is constrained due to external factors. Consideration is subsequently allocated to the identified performance \\r\\nobligation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor services provided over time, consideration is recognised when the service is provided to the customer assuming that a \\r\\nsignificant reversal of consideration will not occur. Examples of income earned for services satisfied over time include the \\r\\nfee income earned for the asset management services.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf a performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time, then the income is recognised when the service is transferred to \\r\\nthe customer. Examples of such income include fee income for executing transactions (clearing and settlement, customers’ \\r\\nsecurities trading, payment cards transaction fees). \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Clarifications) \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Clarifications apply for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. The \\r\\nobjective of the Clarifications is to clarify the IASB’s intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from \\r\\nContracts with Customers, particularly the accounting of identifying performance obligations amending the wording of the \\r\\n“separately identifiable” principle, of principal versus agent considerations including the assessment of whether an entity is \\r\\na principal or an agent as well as applications of control principles and of licensing providing additional guidance for \\r\\naccounting of intellectual property and royalties. The Clarifications also provide additional practical expedients for entities \\r\\nthat either apply IFRS 15 fully retrospectively or that elect to apply the modified retrospective approach. As described above, \\r\\nmanagement has assessed that the application of the standard did not have any material effect on the Group financial \\r\\nstatements. \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 Leases \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. All leases \\r\\nresult in the lessee obtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and, if lease payments are made over time, \\r\\nalso obtaining financing. Accordingly, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance \\r\\nleases as is required by IAS 17 and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Lessees will be required to \\r\\nrecognise: (a) assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low \\r\\nvalue; and (b) depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the income statement. IFRS 16 \\r\\nsubstantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its \\r\\nleases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently. The Group decided \\r\\nthat it will apply the standard using the modified retrospective method. The Group recognised a right of use asset of  4,998 \\r\\nthousand Euro against a corresponding lease liability of 5,337 thousand Euro on 1 January 2019, the impact to the equity as \\r\\nof 1st of January 2019 amounts to 339 thousand Euro. \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 3. RISK MANAGEMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures \\r\\nrequired in the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with the Group's annual financial statements \\r\\nas at 31 December 2017.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been no major changes in the risk management or in any risk management policies since year’s end. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n24 \\r\\n\\r\\nKEY JUDGMENTS, INPUTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES USED FOR ASSESSING EXPECTED \\r\\nCREDIT LOSSES \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the adoption of IFRS 9, a three-stage model was introduced: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Stage 1 – part of the portfolio for which no significant deterioration in credit quality has occurred since initial \\r\\nrecognition (or the exposure is of low credit risk) and the financial instrument is not considered credit-impaired; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Stage 2 – part of the portfolio for which significant deterioration in credit quality has occurred since initial recognition, \\r\\nevidenced by the SICR – significant increase in credit risk – indicator, and the financial instrument is not considered \\r\\ncredit-impaired; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Stage 3 – credit-impaired part of the portfolio. Luminor equates default and credit-impairment definitions so that all \\r\\ndefaulted exposures are treated as credit-impaired and all credit-impaired exposures are treated as defaulted. This \\r\\napproach is based on the fact that the default definition used by the Bank covers all events indicated by IFRS 9 as \\r\\npossible evidence that financial instrument is credit-impaired and all of these events are considered by Luminor as \\r\\nhaving a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows from the instrument. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional category is POCI financial assets - financial assets that were purchased or originated as credit-impaired. POCI \\r\\nassets are subject to unchanging classification, i.e. financial asset once classified as POCI remains in this group until \\r\\nderecognized. The POCI classification is determined at the financial instrument level. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor applies low credit risk exemption to the following classes of exposures: \\r\\n\\r\\n• central governments, \\r\\n• central bank, \\r\\n• regional governments, \\r\\n• local authorities, \\r\\n• institutions. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe counterparty must fulfil the condition of having a credit rating indicating investment grade. \\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, the financial asset is treated as facing significant increase in credit risk if at least one of the following SICR \\r\\nindicators is identified after initial recognition of the financial instrument and was not present as of its origination: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Significant increase of 12-month PD – significant increase of point-in-time (PIT) forward-looking 12-month PD since \\r\\ninitial recognition until reporting date (2.5 times and 0.6 p.p. jointly), \\r\\n\\r\\n• Risk grade 9 or 10 – risk grade 9 or 10 as of reporting date, \\r\\n• 30 days past due – more than 30 days past due as of reporting date, \\r\\n• Forborne performing – forborne performing status as of reporting date (forbearance not triggering non-performing \\r\\n\\r\\nstatus) in accordance with FINREP instruction reporting requirements, \\r\\n• Watch list – watch list status as of reporting date. \\r\\n \\r\\nAll of the SICR indicators are recognized at financial instrument level in order to track changes in credit risk since initial \\r\\nrecognition date for a particular financial instrument, even though some of them refer to the customer’s characteristics. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor identifies default when either or both of the following default indicators have taken place:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• The customer is more than 90 days past due on any material obligation to the Bank; \\r\\n• The customer is considered unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank.  \\r\\n \\r\\nFor exposure to banks, the default is recognized when payments are due more than 7 days. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n25 \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of identifying unlikelihood of payment,  the elements taken as indications of unlikelihood of payment \\r\\ninclude the following: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Distressed restructuring of credit obligation (forbearance triggering non-performing status in accordance with FINREP \\r\\ninstruction requirements);  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Major financial problems of the customer (present or expected), i.e. significant financial difficulties; \\r\\n• Recognition of specific credit risk adjustment resulting from a significant decline in credit quality of the exposure; \\r\\n• Bankruptcy of the customer or similar protection; \\r\\n• Disappearance of an active market for a financial asset because of the financial difficulties of the customer; \\r\\n• Sell of credit obligation at material credit-related economic loss; \\r\\n• Purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses; \\r\\n• Credit fraud; \\r\\n• External rating indicating default. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe default is recognised at the customer level. \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn to a non-defaulted status is possible not earlier than after 3 months when all default triggers cease to be met. During \\r\\nthese 3 months of the probation period, the timely payments by the customer should be ensured. The exemption from the \\r\\ngeneral rule of probation is distressed restructuring where at least 1 year needs to pass since the moment that restructuring \\r\\nmeasures were extended and the moment when a customer is deemed to have an ability to comply with the post-\\r\\nrestructuring conditions. This approach is consistent with FINREP instruction requirements for treatment of forborne non-\\r\\nperforming exposures. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the shift from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 approach, the incurred loss model was replaced by the expected credit loss (ECL) model. \\r\\nFor Stage 1 financial assets, loss allowances equal the 12-month ECL while for Stage 2 and Stage 3 financial instruments, \\r\\nlifetime ECL is calculated.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Purchased or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) financial assets, ECL is estimated in the lifetime horizon until the \\r\\nmaturity. The loss expected at initial recognition is referred to as Initial impairment. In subsequent periods, only the \\r\\ncumulative changes in the lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition are recognised in profit or loss. Collective \\r\\nassessment of impairment is performed for all financial instruments that are not defaulted as of the reporting date, i.e. are \\r\\nclassified as either Stage 1 or Stage 2 or are non-defaulted POCI asset. The expected loss is calculated as the probability-\\r\\nweighted average of losses expected in different macroeconomic scenarios. Expected loss in concrete macroeconomic \\r\\nscenario is calculated as the multiple of probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and \\r\\ncumulative prepayment rate and is discounted using the effective interest rate. PD curves, LGD curves and EAD curves are \\r\\nestimated for all months until the maturity date of the facility. If the facility is classified as Stage 1, expected losses are \\r\\nestimated over the period of up to 12 months. If the facility is classified as Stage 2, then the expected loss is estimated over \\r\\nthe period up to maturity date of the facility. \\r\\n\\r\\nEstimation of PD and LGD curves take into account forward-looking macroeconomic information. The methodology of \\r\\nestimation of these risk parameters includes modelling of the relationship between risk parameters and macroeconomic \\r\\nvariables. Forecasts of macroeconomic variables under different scenarios for 3 upcoming years together with scenario \\r\\nprobabilities are prepared by Luminor macroeconomists. Three macroeconomic scenarios are considered: the \\r\\nbaseline/realistic, positive, and pessimistic scenarios (with the probability weights of 60%, 25% and 15% respectively). \\r\\nMacroeconomic scenarios that are prepared for the estimation of expected losses are consistent with scenarios which are \\r\\nused in credit risk stress testing process. Macroeconomic variables that are included in the modelling are annual change in \\r\\nreal GDP, unemployment rate and annual change of residential real estate price. Starting from the fourth year. it is assumed \\r\\nthat risk parameters (PD and LGD) converge to their long-term average levels. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n26 \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stage 3 exposures (or defaulted POCI assets), which are classified as material, Luminor evaluates the impairment amount \\r\\non individual basis (individual assessment) under discounted cash flows (DCF) method. Two scenarios – base case and risk \\r\\ncase – are used. For exceptional cases, usage of one scenario can be sufficient. The circumstances when only one scenario \\r\\nmight be acceptable could be the deep workout case or the case when total exposure of defaulted borrower falls below \\r\\nthe materiality threshold. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stage 3 exposures (or defaulted POCI assets), which are classified as immaterial, Luminor evaluates the impairment \\r\\namount on collective basis (collective assessment). Impairment is calculated applying the pool rate for the unsecured part. \\r\\nDifferent pool rates are applied for these pools distinguished by Luminor: \\r\\n\\r\\n• mortgage loans and private credits to private individuals, \\r\\n• consumer loans and other loans to private individuals (including leasing), \\r\\n• SMEs (all financial instruments to legal entities). \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 4. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new expected loss approach model had a negative impact on the Bank’s regulatory capital. By  decision of the Board \\r\\nof Directors of Luminor Group AB, the Bank did not apply transitional arrangements allowed by EU Regulation 2017/2395 \\r\\nand recognised the full effect of the implementation of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. The capital adequacy ratio is still \\r\\nsignificantly above the regulatory minimum and in line with the internal Risk Appetite statement. \\r\\n\\r\\n T EUR 31 Dec 2018 31 Dec 2017 \\r\\n\\r\\nOWN FUNDS     \\r\\n\\r\\n1.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. \\r\\nWhere the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be \\r\\nderived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of \\r\\nmathematical models. The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but where \\r\\nobservable market data is not available, judgment is required to establish fair values.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of loans to customers, customer deposits, amounts due from credit institutions and amounts due to credit \\r\\ninstitutions and other financial assets and liabilities, obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash \\r\\nflows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn assessing the fair value for financial assets, the management has performed discounted cash flow analysis; up-to-date \\r\\nmarket information at the moment of assessment is used for assessing cash flows. For loans, where base interest rates are \\r\\npegged to floating market interest rates, the Group has considered the difference between the average interest margin of \\r\\nissued loans and average interest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has not \\r\\nbeen changed (increased) since issuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal \\r\\nto fair value. \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value of financial liabilities at amortized cost such as Loans and deposits from credit institutions and Deposits from \\r\\ncustomers which are not on demand have been estimated based on discounted cash flow model using interest rates for \\r\\nsimilar products as at period’s end. Fair value of those financial liabilities that are on demand or have floating interest rate \\r\\nhave been estimated to be approximately equal to its carrying amount. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n31 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe table below summarizes the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank financial assets and liabilities accounted for \\r\\nat fair value. Financial instruments are distributed by 3 levels of fair value: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \\r\\n• Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value     measurement is \\r\\n\\r\\ndirectly or indirectly observable. \\r\\n• Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is \\r\\n\\r\\nunobservable. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of all Bank contracted derivatives  is defined as level 2. These are interest rate swaps and in all cases pricing \\r\\nis based on market observable inputs. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no movements of financial instruments between the levels during 2018 and 2017. \\r\\n\\r\\nValuation of all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value was performed as at 31 December 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\n  Fair value measurement using \\r\\n\\r\\n T EUR Date of valuation \\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\n\\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets 31.12.2018     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash balances with \\r\\ncentral banks \\r\\n\\r\\n 701 963 0 0 701 963 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n 0 0 109 208 109 208 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments  0 2 330 0 2 330 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\nthrough profit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\n 0 4 356 0 4 356 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables  0 0 3 212 788 3 212 788 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   701 963 6 686 3 321 996 4 030 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities 31.12.2018     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n 0 0 1 471 984 1 471 984 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers  0 0 1 724 550 1 724 550 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued  0 351 235 0 351 235 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments  0 2 312 0 2 312 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   0 353 547 3 196 534 3 550 081 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets 31.12.2017     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash balances with \\r\\ncentral banks \\r\\n\\r\\n 199 250 0 0 199 250 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit \\r\\ninstitutions (demand)  \\r\\n\\r\\n 0 0 92 832 92 832 \\r\\n\\r\\nReceivables from parent pledged \\r\\nas collateral \\r\\n\\r\\n 0 0 37 647 37 647 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n32 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments  0 4 161 0 4 161 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\nthrough profit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\n 0 4 526 0 4 526 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables  0 0 3 239 414 3 239 414 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   199 250 8 687 3 374 419 3 577 830 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities 31.12.2017     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2017 0 0 1 397 509 1 397 509 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers  0 0 1 648 598 1 648 598 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued  0 0 65 007 65 007 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments  0 4 161 0 4 161 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   0 4 161 3 111 114 3 115 275 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nDemand deposits due from credit institutions and loans and receivables to customers are issued on market conditions. \\r\\nTherefore, the fair value of these financial assets does not materially differ from their carrying amount as at 31 December \\r\\n2018 and 31 December 2017.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF PERFORMANCE OF OPERATING SEGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief \\r\\nOperating Decision Maker (CODM), as required by IFRS 8. At Luminor, the CODM has been defined as Group Executive \\r\\nManagement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Executive Management Committee monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of \\r\\nmaking decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on \\r\\noperating profits or losses and is measured consistently with operating profits or losses in the consolidated financial \\r\\nstatements. Interest income is reported net as management primarily relies on net interest revenue as a performance \\r\\nmeasure, along with the gross income and expense. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 October 2017, Luminor Group implemented new reportable operating segments, and therefore there is no \\r\\ncomparable data with respective segmentation for previous periods.  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n35 \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF SEGMENTATION \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the four main business areas: Corporate Banking, Business Clients, Household and Private \\r\\nBanking.

The Household segment serves Luminor’s household customers in the \\r\\nBaltic markets, through various channels offering a full range of financial services and solutions. The business area includes \\r\\nadvisory and service staff, channels, product units, back office and IT under a common strategy, operating model and \\r\\ngovernance across markets.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking provides high-quality investment, savings and risk management products. It also manages customers’ assets \\r\\nand gives financial advice to affluent and high net worth individuals as well as to institutional investors.

The COVID-19 \\r\\npandemic made us swiftly readjust the priorities that we had set for the year, with ensuring the safety of our employees and customers \\r\\nbecoming our main focus.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is an important part of the Baltic economy. We continue to offer banking services and financial infrastructure in our home \\r\\nmarkets even under the emergency situations declared by the Baltic governments, while taking comprehensive measures to assure \\r\\nthe safety of our employees and customers. We are helping to mitigate the economic harm caused by the pandemic by offering \\r\\nsimplified grace period solutions for both private individuals and corporate customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nCollaboration is one of Luminor’s core values and we view it as vitally important both in dealing efficiently with the current situation \\r\\nand in preparing to come out of it. Luminor has taken an active role in developing the measures that the Baltic governments have \\r\\nprepared for stimulating the economies and mitigating the impact of COVID-19. We will use state guarantees to provide investment \\r\\nand working capital loans to companies in all three countries and we are also investigating how we can participate in the guarantee \\r\\nprogrammes offered by the European Investment Fund.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor started the year with a significantly improved funding position and we fully intend to use our strong financial standing for \\r\\nthe benefit of our customers. We have introduced a new operating model and made our operations more efficient, so we were \\r\\nstronger and nimbler when the crisis hit, which allowed us to adapt quickly to the changing circumstances. We continued to improve \\r\\nour funding structure in the first quarter of 2020 and we have brought the loan-to-deposit ratio down to 99.7% from 108.4% a year \\r\\nago. The underlying business performance without extraordinary expenses has improved as well. There was a net loss in the first \\r\\nquarter of 21.2 million EUR that was due mainly to provisions for credit impairments caused by the spread of COVID-19.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 March, Luminor issued the first covered bonds from the Baltic region, for 500 million EUR, with an interest rate spread over mid-\\r\\nswap of 0.25% and a final yield of -0.18%. This set the record for the lowest-ever rate paid by a non-government issuer from the \\r\\nBaltics. The funds received were used to broaden our funding base and to increase our liquidity buffers further. \\r\\n\\r\\nRemote services have become additionally important for health and safety reasons during the current crisis. We have put more people \\r\\nin our call centres to advise our customers, and we launched remote customer onboarding in Latvia in the first quarter of this year, \\r\\nwhich made us the first bank in the country to provide this service fully remotely. The service will be extended to Lithuania and Estonia \\r\\nduring 2020. Another step in promoting our online business was the launch of the e-Commerce Gateway, an acquiring solution for \\r\\nonline merchants in all three Baltic countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is also making good progress in becoming independent from the networks and payment systems of our former parent banks. \\r\\nIn the first quarter of this year, we finished setting up independent payment infrastructure on all the core banking systems in the \\r\\nthree countries. We are also making strong headway with the carveout on international payment flows processed through the Nordea \\r\\nGroup, and we plan to become fully independent on those payments during the first half of 2020. Although current circumstances \\r\\nforced us to revisit our migration schedule at the end of March, the process of moving our customer accounts to the targeted unified \\r\\nsystems is progressing, and it should be finalised in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in 2020. Luminor Retail Banking increased its presence \\r\\nin the housing loan market by 5% and continued to focus on balanced active sales of lending products and on attracting customer \\r\\ndeposits in the first quarter of 2020, but market fluctuations caused by the first impacts of the current pandemic were already being \\r\\nwitnessed at the end of March. Corporate Banking focused on measures to help our customers cope with the heavy blow dealt to \\r\\ntheir business developments by the outbreak of the virus. More than 24 million EUR of provisions for credit losses were set up in \\r\\nCorporate Banking in the first quarter, with 90% of those provisions in response to the expected impact of COVID-19 on the financial \\r\\nstanding of our customers and to sharply lower oil prices.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe distress caused in financial markets by the pandemic has also impacted pension assets under management, which fell to 1.3 \\r\\nbillion EUR. This is down 11% from the end of 2019 and is at the same level as a year before. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor remains committed to our proactive and vigilant stance in detecting and preventing money laundering and terrorism \\r\\nfinancing, and in the first quarter of 2020 we continued to enhance our financial crime risk management framework. \\r\\n\\r\\nLike the rest of the euro area, the Baltics are preparing to take a hit from the economic impact of the health crisis and the ensuing \\r\\nlockdown of economies. It is of the utmost importance that we start focusing on how those economies will recover, with the aid of \\r\\nsubstantial support from both the EU and national governments. The Baltic banks are well capitalised with stronger balance sheets \\r\\nand can be part of the solution by extending liquidity and keeping the credit flowing to the real economy. Intensive work is being \\r\\ndone at Luminor to prepare for how the economic lockdown will impact the economy. We are strengthening the organisational \\r\\ncapabilities that will let us support our customers, we are working with different scenarios for how the crisis will evolve and for the \\r\\neconomic impact it will have, we are reviewing our costs and financial plans, and we are doing much more besides. More importantly, \\r\\nwe are preparing for how we can contribute to restarting the economy.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 4  \\r\\n\\r\\nI am very grateful to the entire Luminor team, who have responded wonderfully well in dealing with these extraordinary \\r\\ncircumstances and ensuring the vital banking services and support that our customers need, while also preparing for how we will exit \\r\\nthis crisis. Building tomorrow starts today. \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\n\\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 5  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral information \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor) was established on 1 October 2017 through the merger of the Baltic operations of DNB Bank ASA \\r\\n(Commercial Register no. 984 851 006, DNB) and Nordea Bank Abp (Commercial Register no. 2858394-9, Nordea) to create a new-\\r\\ngeneration financial service provider for local businesses and financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 it was announced that the transaction signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB, Nordea and US-based \\r\\nprivate equity firm Blackstone had been concluded and as a result a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone \\r\\nacquired a 60.1% majority stake in the bank. The bank’s initial owners Nordea and DNB each retained a 19.95% equity stake in \\r\\nLuminor, but an arrangement has been made by the consortium and Nordea for the purchase of Nordea’s remaining stake over the \\r\\ncoming years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with some 900 000 clients, 2 501 employees, and market share \\r\\nof 16.0% in deposits and 18.0% in lending as at the end of March 2020. Luminor has total shareholders’ equity of 1.6 billion EUR and \\r\\nit is capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 20.5%. Luminor’s core business is serving entrepreneurial people in the Baltics with a primary \\r\\nfocus on local companies and the financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers its customers a wide range of products and services through all possible channels, digital and physical, with 34 \\r\\ncustomer service centres in total in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, of which nine are meet-up points. Luminor owns 357 ATMs \\r\\nthroughout the Baltic states, and additionally provides services through 100 ATMs in partnership with other financial services \\r\\nproviders.  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Estonia Latvia Lithuania GroupGr Total  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of customers ~132 000 ~226 000 ~566 000 ~924 000 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket shares      \\r\\n\\r\\nLending 12.9% 22.9% 19.7% 18.0% \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits 8.7% 17.2% 20.9% 16.0% \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of client service \\r\\ncentres, including meet- up \\r\\npoints \\r\\n\\r\\n8 10 16 34  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of employees 600 875 1 026 2 501 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is clear by now that the COVID-19 outbreak will have significant economic implications, although it is hard to predict the length and \\r\\nseverity of its impact. The consensus outlook for global growth for 2020 is clearly negative, with a recovery coming only in 2021. The \\r\\nimpact on the Baltic economies is likely to be concentrated in the second and third quarters of the year, and that impact will be \\r\\nsevere, but temporary.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, however, a significant degree of uncertainty in how the gradual re-opening of the economies will impact the spreading of \\r\\nthe virus. The Baltic states were quick at closing borders and imposing social distancing, and hence currently have fatalities per million \\r\\ninhabitants which are less than 5% of the levels seen in large parts of Europe (e.g. the UK, France, Benelux). Whether this is indicative \\r\\nof a more successful strategy of protecting public health, or whether we are looking at a more prolonged impact from the virus in the \\r\\nBaltics, is too early to say.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe experience of other countries hit by COVID-19 suggests that growth will drop substantially in the Baltic economies in the near \\r\\nterm, as both production and consumption is negatively impacted by the measures needed to contain the virus, and from the \\r\\ndisruption of global supply chains. Sharp recessions in the Baltic economies, concentrated to the second quarter, are very likely, but \\r\\nshould be followed by a gradual recovery from Q3 onwards. Some of the key trading partners for the Baltic states, including Germany \\r\\nand Denmark, have already taken the first steps towards a gradual reopening of their economies. GDP growth in the euro area, the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 6  \\r\\n\\r\\nkey destination for Baltic exports, however decelerated noticeably already in the end of 2019, to only 1% in the fourth quarter \\r\\ncompared to a year earlier, being dragged down by lower activity levels in manufacturing and trade.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe economic expansion in the Baltic states has been robust in recent years, with GDP growth outpacing the euro area average by a \\r\\nsignificant margin. In addition, in stark contrast to the situation going into the Global Financial Crisis, Baltic private as well as public \\r\\nsector debt in relation to GDP is among the lowest in Europe, which may cusion the economic shock from the pandemic. Domestic \\r\\ndemand and business activity held up well in the region until the pandemic started, with very tight labour markets supporting high-\\r\\nsingle digit wage growth and strong retail sales. However, this strong starting points does not entirely insulate the region’s economies \\r\\nfrom feeling the impact from the pandemic.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has delivered substantial support for the euro area as a whole, and the Baltic countries will benefit \\r\\non top of this from targeted extraordinary fiscal support measures at both the national and EU levels to mitigate the consequences \\r\\nof the crisis. The impact of these measures is yet uncertain however, as the crisis hits subsegments of the economy very differently \\r\\nand the availability of the fiscal support for those sectors mostly hit. There is no doubt that the loss of activity in the coming quarters \\r\\nwill be significant, but it is crucial that the economies can recover swiftly after the spread of the virus has been contained and as the \\r\\ngradual reopening from lockdown proceeds.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19  \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the outbreak of COVID-19, all three Baltic countries declared a state of emergency, and as a result the regular way of living was \\r\\nchanged immediately. Different measures were put in place to decrease the speed of infection, and thereby protect public health, \\r\\nand ensure the stability of the health care system. Many of these measures have had severe effects on regular activities in the \\r\\nsocieties, impacting directly or indirectly businesses and jobs. \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the footsteps of other countries in the world, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian governments have launched programs to  \\r\\nstimulate the economies to mitigate the negative effects from the pandemic. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt large, the state measures put in place can be divided into five major categories, represented in all Baltic countries: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Employment measures – granting limited sums per person to support the individuals, who have lost all or majority of their \\r\\n\\r\\nincome, and companies, to allow them to keep people employed, in order to survive state of emergency; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Tax measures – allowing exemptions or suspension or deductions of tax contributions of private individuals and companies \\r\\n\\r\\nin affected sectors; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Liquidity measures – deferring tax deadlines, granting loan guarantees and loans to companies; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Stimulating the economy – accelerating investment programs and public expenditure, reducing capital adequacy \\r\\n\\r\\nrequirements for financial institutions; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Sector- or company-specific measures – targeted financial support or loans to sectors and companies most heavily impacted \\r\\n\\r\\n(retail, tourism, large employers), important from national interest or recovery perspective (transportation, aviation, etc). \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Estonia, the state-owned financial institution KredEx is providing capital loans and investment loans, and offers extraordinary loan \\r\\nguarantees in co-operation with banks since the end of March. KredEx targets specific sectors and companies hit by pandemic, as well \\r\\nas projects of national importance, covering amounts up to 5 million EUR per company.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Latvia, the loan guarantees and liquidity loans are provided by state-owned financial institution ALTUM, directly and in cooperation \\r\\nwith commercial banks. Latvia has also introduced number of measures to support retail companies to survive the crisis. There are \\r\\ndifferent tax related measures implemented in Latvia, including repayment of overpaid VAT.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLithuania has introduced a 5 billion EUR “Economic and Financial Action Plan” to support the economy, maintain business liquidity, \\r\\njobs, and healthcare. As an example, small fixed payouts are distributed to self-employed people affected by the state of emergency. \\r\\nLithuania is also injecting 1 billion EUR into the economy by accelerating investment programs, and has introduced a number of tax \\r\\nand consumption-oriented measures.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, there are number of measures targeted at banks - banks can operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by \\r\\nthe Pillar 2 Guidance, the capital conservation buffer and the liquidity coverage ratio requirements, or use capital instruments that \\r\\ndo not qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. In addition, the countercyclical capital buffer and/or systemic risk buffer \\r\\nrequirements have been reduced. The ECB has eased conditions for targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) and added \\r\\nsome funding possibilities for banks (including the Pandemic Emergency Funding Facility). \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 7  \\r\\n\\r\\nBeing an important part of the Baltic economies, in order to support our customers in this difficult time and offer best financial advice, \\r\\nLuminor has kept its customer service centers open, though strict measures have been adopted to protect our employees and \\r\\ncustomers – we are more frequently cleaning the facilities and ATM’s, we have put in place mandatory facemasks and safety screens \\r\\nfor employees, and we also are limiting the number of simultaneous customer visits to service centers. To prevent the spread of virus, \\r\\nover 70% of our employees are working remotely.     \\r\\n\\r\\nTo help our customers withstand the crisis, Luminor offers simplified grace period solutions both to private individuals and corporate \\r\\ncustomers in all three Baltic countries. This means that bank is not asking any additional documents from the customer, not changing \\r\\nthe loan agreement conditions and not taking any fee.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also aim to help distribute the state guaranteed loans, and utilize other potential programs to ensure the availability of investment \\r\\nand working capital loans for companies in all three countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness development \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor completed its cross-border merger on 2 January 2019 and continues its operations in all the three Baltic countries through \\r\\nthe bank headquartered in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all assets, rights and \\r\\nliabilities of Luminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank \\r\\ncontinues its activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches. A new organisational set up and a new \\r\\ngovernance structure were also introduced, and new members of management bodies were appointed.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe deposits and financial instruments of the depositors and customers using the investment services of Luminor Bank AS and its \\r\\nLatvian branch and Lithuanian branch are guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and investor protection scheme established and \\r\\noperated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe process of setting up independent payment infrastructure for all the core banking systems in the three countries was completed \\r\\nin February 2020. Luminor established its own correspondent banks network in 2019 and gained independence in international \\r\\npayments from the correspondent banking accounts of DNB. It is now making good headway with the international payment flows \\r\\nprocessed through the Nordea Group, planning to become independent on payments during the first half of 2020.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe gradual migration of the legacy Nordea customers in Latvia to the Luminor information systems continued in the beginning of \\r\\n2020. The process of finalising the systems and migrating the customers to the targeted unified systems is progressing, with the aim \\r\\nto finalize the migration in all countries during 2020. Even with the ongoing pandemic, this remains one of Luminor’s top priorities \\r\\nfor the year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first quarter of 2020 Luminor continued strengthening its Daily Banking offering with the launch of several new services. Remote \\r\\ncustomer onboarding was launched in Latvia, making Luminor the first bank in the country to provide the service fully remotely. \\r\\nLuminor aims to extent this service to Lithuania and Estonia during the year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor also launched the e-Commerce Gateway, an acquiring solution for online merchants, in all three Baltic states. The e-\\r\\nCommerce Gateway provides card acquiring services for accepting VISA and Mastercard cards, and uses the Open Banking application \\r\\nprogramming interfaces (APIs) of major banks to enable account-to-account payments to be acquired. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor also launched its Black Card in Latvia. This credit card is an excellent value proposition for domestic and overseas use and \\r\\nthe aim is for it to become the target credit card for Luminor customers in all three countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor Investor platform was launched in Estonia in February 2020, following its launch in Latvia and Lithuania in October 2019. \\r\\nThe investment platform is tailored for investors of all levels of experience and offers a wide range of non-complex financial \\r\\ninstruments, with more than 14 500 instruments in total. The platform was built jointly with Scandinavian partners and gives a \\r\\nsimplified customer experience that lets customers build their savings at their own pace. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus of the Retail Banking team remained on achieving balanced sales of our lending products and attracting customer deposits, \\r\\nand it increased the bank’s presence in the housing loan market by 5%, mainly through the Latvian and Lithuanian markets. The \\r\\nmarket share for newly issued consumer loans has increased by some 3% in Latvia and Lithuania, while it declined by 0.4% in the \\r\\nEstonian market. Lending volumes for the mass business customers have remained stable and at the same level as in the first quarter \\r\\nof 2019. The portfolio of deposits of private clients has grown by 4.5% from the same quarter of 2019. By the end of March the Retail \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 8  \\r\\n\\r\\nBanking team was already seeing the first impact of the COVID-19 outbreak as market fluctuations squeezed the assets under \\r\\nmanagement of retail customers by 153 million EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe e-Commerce Gateway was launched for mass business customers at the end of the first quarter and within the first two weeks \\r\\nof launch it had received 52 applications and converted 13 of them into agreements.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team continued to focus on its migration work during the quarter and the first mass business clients were \\r\\nsuccessfully migrated from the legacy Nordea systems to the targeted Luminor unified information systems. The team continued to \\r\\nconsolidate the distribution channels and improve efficiency in related areas. Two service centres were relaunched with a new \\r\\nconcept in the first quarter of 2020 and Luminor was serving its customers in a total of 34 locations across the Baltics.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe top priority for the Corporate Banking team in the first quarter of 2020 was to take measures to help corporate customers cope \\r\\nwith the impact of COVID-19 on their business. More than 24 million EUR of provisions for credit losses were set up in corporate \\r\\nbanking in the first quarter of 2020, and 90% of those provisions were in response to the expected impact of COVID-19 on the financial \\r\\nstanding of clients and to sharply lower oil prices. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lending portfolio decreased by 19% compared to the last year as a result of the repricing and optimisation of the portfolio and \\r\\nslower new sales, partly due to COVID-19. The deposits of corporate customers remained at the same level as in the first quarter of \\r\\n2019, as the Corporate Banking team has been putting more emphasis on improving the quality of deposits by replacing large \\r\\nconcentrated accounts with more diversified SMEs.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income showed solid results as higher market volatility brought along increased customer activity in the risk hedging \\r\\ntransactions. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nWealth Management introduced several new solutions for our customers in the first quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor Investor platform was rolled out in full in all three Baltic states and was promoted to customers interested in financial \\r\\ninvestments, also the new VISA Infinite card for the Private Banking segment was introduced for Latvian and Lithuanian customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness growth and customer satisfaction remained firmly in the focus of the Private Banking and Pensions teams. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe distress caused in financial markets by COVID-19 reduced the pension assets managed to 1.3 billion EUR, which was roughly the \\r\\nsame as a year earlier and 11% down from the end of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the first quarter Luminor had 291 000 second pillar pension customers and 63 000 third pillar customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Private Banking team focused on growing the assets under management and reached 1.37 billion EUR in the first quarter of 2020, \\r\\nwhich was 7% more than in the same quarter of 2019 and 3.6% less than at the end of 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus remains on achieving a high level of customer satisfaction by being available for our customers, and on ensuring operational \\r\\ncommunication in the face of the elevated volatility in financial markets.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe safety and well-being of Luminor employees and customers has been and remains our top priority in all our activities. We at \\r\\nLuminor are keeping our customer service centers open and continuing to offer banking services to our customers even under the \\r\\ncurrent difficult circumstances, but we have taken comprehensive measures to assure the safety of our employees and our customers. \\r\\nThese measures include the maximum possible use of remote work, extra attention to cleaning and the availability of disinfectants in \\r\\nall our facilities and ATM’s, the provision of protective equipment for all our employees, and limits on the number of customer visits \\r\\nto the customer service centers at any one time. \\r\\n\\r\\nRemote services have become especially crucial in the current pandemic, and Luminor has encouraged customers to use digital \\r\\nservices to the greatest extent possible. Working together with our partners, Luminor initiated a community investment project in \\r\\nthe first quarter of 2020 that aims to help local companies take their business online or advance their current e-business capabilities. \\r\\nWe are also currently offering our payment solution e- Commerce Gateway for free so that we can help promote safer e-business. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 9  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapidly changing environment, the large number of unknowns, and the new ways of working can all cause considerable stress. \\r\\nFor that reason, we are paying special attention to communication and consultation with our employees so that we can aid them in \\r\\nadapting to the new circumstances and let them focus on their work and life balance. Separate webinars to share the knowledge we \\r\\nhave gained have been delivered for Luminor customers, covering topics like remote working and cyber security during the current \\r\\ncrisis.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn our concern for environmental sustainability, Luminor developed risk-adjusted environmental and social risk evaluation procedures \\r\\nin the first quarter of 2020 to be applied to all legal entities. The procedure requires E&S evaluation for every new customers and \\r\\nduring every annual review of existing customers with a limit extending EUR 0.5 million. To support this, we ran training courses for \\r\\nthe employees most connected to the topic.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEfficient governance is of great importance to us and so we reviewed and updated Luminor’s governance policies and procedures. An \\r\\naudit was carried out in this that recommended further improvements to the Management Board. \\r\\n\\r\\nEFFORTS TO PREVENT FINANCIAL CRIME  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor remains vigilant and committed to detecting and preventing financial crime, and we regularly review our anti-financial crime \\r\\n(AFC) practices and invest in the human and technological resources that are needed. We work constantly to get a better \\r\\nunderstanding of our customers and their transactions, and to manage and report any potential financial crime risk. Luminor \\r\\npredominantly serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers who have a strong personal or business connection \\r\\nto the Baltic states. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Luminor has further enhanced its financial crime risk management framework to prevent, detect, \\r\\nmanage and report potential financial crime risk, and this has supported its conservative approach towards money laundering and \\r\\nfinancial crime. The framework covers technology, policies and procedures for detecting financial crime, risk assessments, training \\r\\nand awareness-raising, and ongoing monitoring of new and developing financial crime risks. As we are subject to a wide range of legal \\r\\nrequirements, Luminor is transparent in all its activities and works closely with all the supervisory and regulatory authorities. Luminor \\r\\nalso follows the international guidelines, recommendations and standards issued by the regulatory and supervisory authorities, \\r\\ninternational bodies and local banking associations, and the financial intelligence units in each Baltic state. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to invest in its systems and processes so it can adapt in a constantly changing environment. The bank is further \\r\\ndeveloping its common monitoring and screening solution in all three Baltic states and has envisaged several further developments \\r\\nthat are to be delivered during 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor considers that awareness-raising activities are an important component of the financial crime risk management framework. \\r\\nDuring the first quarter, 31 training events related to AFC and corporate compliance areas were held on 10 different topics.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER EVENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 27 Auri Loog joined Luminor as the Head of Internal Audit Division. She is a Certified Internal Auditor with a solid \\r\\nexperience in banking and auditing sectors. The former Head of Internal Audit Jelena Gute went on to lead Luminor’s Group Finance \\r\\nDepartment. \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 31 MARCH 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to be prepared for dealing efficiently and expertly with the additional workload potentially caused by the economic impact \\r\\nof COVID-19 and support our customers also in the most difficult cases, a Credit Advisory and Restructuring division has been \\r\\nestablished as of 1 May 2020. It is a temporary dedicated unit with a planned duration of 18 months with a possible 6-month extension \\r\\nperiod, supporting the current teams working in this field. The Head of the new division is Solvita Deglava. She has strong experience \\r\\nin the restructuring area, having worked in that capacity in different banks. \\r\\n\\r\\n   \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 10  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results \\r\\n\\r\\nNet loss in the first quarter amounted to 21.2 million EUR and was mainly driven by loan loss provisions as a result of the COVID-19 \\r\\npandemic. Loan loss provisions amounted to 26.4 million EUR compared to 7.3 million EUR net reversals in same period last year, \\r\\nresulting in a 1.05% loan loss ratio. \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income in the first quarter was 54.1 million EUR compared to 63.8 million EUR a year ago and was impacted by continued \\r\\nrepricing and rightsizing of the balance sheet. Interest income declined by 3% while the loan portfolio decreased by 12% as a result \\r\\nof planned effort to ensure fair pricing of risk and improve profitability. Interest expense increased by 54% or 5.8 million EUR as a \\r\\nresult of the process to become an independently funded bank and continuous work with funding diversification. Consequently, net \\r\\ninterest income-to-loans ratio in the first quarter was 2.2% compared to 2.3% in the same period last year. Net commission income \\r\\ndecreased by 5% compared to same quarter last year, with one of the key drivers being early signs of lower customer activity due to \\r\\nCOVID-19 pandemic. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses in the first quarter were 71.4 million EUR and have decreased by 1% compared to the same period last year. \\r\\nExceptional costs have increased from 17.2 million EUR in the first quarter last year to 25.3 million EUR this year. In the first quarter \\r\\nthis year the largest part were IT expenses, which constituted 89% and other costs were 11% of total exceptional expenses.

The \\r\\ncomposition has been stable, with deposits from individual customers comprising 40% of the deposit portfolio of Luminor at the Baltic \\r\\nlevel, followed by 39% from business customers and 17% from public sector. Luminor’s share of the deposit market in the Baltics has \\r\\ndecreased from 16.9% to 16.0% over the past 12 months. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 12  \\r\\n\\r\\nASSET QUALITY FOR Q1 2020   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe adverse impact of COVID-19 is reflected in asset quality of Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most severe consequences will most probably be seen in industries like accommodation, tourism, and aviation. Even though \\r\\nLuminor’s portfolio towards these economic sectors is relatively small, negative trends in the portfolio are still observed since many \\r\\nother industries are quite severely affected as well. As a result, requests for modifications (including grace period) reached 0.9 billion \\r\\nEUR at the end of March 2020 and exceeded 1.1 billion EUR (11% of the total credit portfolio) by the middle of April 2020.  \\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the situation, and the generous terms for modifications, the number of modifications has been limited so far.  \\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 70% of modification requests came from business customers. Earlier applications for modification from business \\r\\ncustomers compared to individual customers can be explained by the following reasons: \\r\\n\\r\\n• business customers have been affected first; moreover, professional financial management leads business customers to \\r\\n\\r\\nimmediately approach the bank, if foreseeing the need for modifications;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• individual customers often have unemployment benefits. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest part of modification requests from business customers are for industries like real estate activities, transportation and \\r\\nstorage, wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common modification type is grace period on principal payments. Luminor is restrictive (applying only exceptionally) \\r\\ntowards granting full grace period (including grace on interest payments). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe volume of overdue loans is fluctuating and not yet showing negative trends, however, depending on the development of the \\r\\npandemic and measures taken by governments, this might accelerate in the second quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first quarter, Luminor loan loss provisions reached 26.4 million EUR. Approximately 50% of the provisions was for Stage 3 \\r\\nwhile the rest was for Stage 1 and 2 exposures. Stage 1 and 2 provisions increased mainly due to changes in the macroeconomic \\r\\noutlook in the models, and an increase of watch list customers. 60% of Stage 3 provisions in the period related to new non-performing \\r\\nloans (NPLs). In addition, 30% represented additional provisions on existing NPLs relating to the energy sector. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe share of non-performing loans (NPL ratio) was 3.9% at the end of the quarter, which is an increase of 0.1 percentage points from \\r\\nthe previous quarter. The NPL ratio for the mortgage loans portfolio was unchanged at 2.9%. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal impairment allowances on the balance sheet were 197.2 million EUR at the end of the quarter, of which 142.2 million EUR \\r\\nrelated to Stage 3 exposures. This can be compared with total non-performing loans of 393.5 million EUR.  \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March

A key requirement for achieving this is \\r\\nthat the former parent funding provided in equal parts by DNB and Nordea should gradually be replaced by other forms of funding \\r\\nsuch as deposits and wholesale funding from third parties.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has achieved tangible results in getting closer to being a self-funded banking group. Deposits from customers stood at 9 959 \\r\\nmillion EUR at the end of the first quarter of 2020, and at 10 235 million EUR on 31 December 2019. In March 2020 Luminor issued \\r\\nits inaugural five-year covered bond for 500 million EUR, which received a long-term rating of Aa1 from Moody’s. The covered bond \\r\\nissuance raised the value of bonds outstanding under the EMTN programme to 1 156 million EUR at the end of the first quarter of \\r\\n2020 from 652 million EUR at 31 December 2019. The senior unsecured bonds issued under the EMTN programme have been assigned \\r\\na rating of Baa2 by Moody’s.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to its deposits from customers and wholesale funding, Luminor has outstanding debt facility lines with its former parent \\r\\ncompanies DNB and Nordea. This funding amounted to 150 million EUR at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and was provided in \\r\\nthe form of a syndicate, with each syndicate partner providing 50%. The covered bond issuance meant the total amount committed \\r\\nto the facility under the agreement, used and unused combined, was reduced to 2 337 million EUR as at 31 March 2020 from 2 837 \\r\\nmillion EUR as at 31 December 2019. The amount of the facility is committed for five years from 1 October 2019, initially three years \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 17  \\r\\n\\r\\nwith the option for Luminor to extend it by up to two years, and it can be drawn with maturities of one, two or three years. The facility \\r\\nis partly secured, as Luminor has assigned mortgage loans to it with a carrying value of 1 762 million EUR as at 31 March 2020 and 1 \\r\\n929 million EUR as at 31 December 2019. The total committed but unused credit line was 2 187 million EUR as at the end of the first \\r\\nquarter of 2020 and 1 932 million EUR as at 31 December 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 April 2020 Luminor received its minimum own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) requirement as a decision of the Single \\r\\nResolution Board (SRB) dated 20 December 2019 that was executed for Luminor by the decision of  Finantsinspektsioon, the Estonian \\r\\nFSA, dated 1 April 2020. The MREL decision sets the following MREL requirements for Luminor: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Holding AS (parent company of Luminor Bank AS) shall comply with the MREL at the consolidated level of Luminor \\r\\nBank AS, on a consolidated level of 17.28% of total liabilities and own funds at all times, and 11.97% of total liabilities and \\r\\nown funds shall be met with subordinated instruments; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Holding AS shall have a transitional period until 30 June 2022 to comply with these requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 March 2020 the total MREL ratio stands at 17.0% on the consolidated level of Luminor Bank AS (16.3% as at 31 December \\r\\n2019) and 12.1% of total liabilities and own funds were subordinated instruments (11.5% as at 31 December 2019) . It should be noted \\r\\nthat the MREL requirements have been set using data from 31 March 2019. This means the decision does not consider any subsequent \\r\\nevents.  \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, \\r\\nwith a stable outlook. There have been no changes to Luminor’s ratings since then. On 25 March 2020 Moody’s issued an updated \\r\\ncredit opinion for Luminor.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 March 2020 Moody’s assigned a definitive Aa1 rating to the mortgage covered bonds issued by Luminor Bank AS under the \\r\\nEstonian Covered Bonds Act. \\r\\n\\r\\n  LIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s structural liquidity risk is conservative and well-balanced, and based on metrics to measure liquidity risk, is appropriately \\r\\nadopted to the current economic and regulatory environment. Luminor uses a range of metrics to measure liquidity risk. One metric \\r\\nused is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The LCR for Luminor was 144% as at the end of the first quarter and 150% as at 31 December \\r\\n2019 by the definition of the LCR in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). The liquidity buffer is composed of highly liquid central \\r\\nbank eligible securities and cash. Long-term liquidity risk is measured as the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). As at the end of the first \\r\\nquarter of 2020, Luminor’s NSFR was 126%, while as at 31 December 2019 it was 123%.  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n372\\r\\n\\r\\n4 271\\r\\n3 950\\r\\n\\r\\n1738\\r\\n\\r\\n150\\r\\n\\r\\n1156\\r\\n1610\\r\\n\\r\\nAll other Liabilities Corporate\\r\\n\\r\\ndeposits\\r\\n\\r\\nRetail deposits Public sector\\r\\n\\r\\ndeposits\\r\\n\\r\\nParent Funding Debt securit ies\\r\\n\\r\\nissued\\r\\n\\r\\nEquity\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 18  \\r\\n\\r\\n Q1  2020 Q4  2019 Q3  2019 Q2 2019 Q1  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 143.7% 149.8% 144.3% 132.5% 131.2% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR 126.0% 123.0% 118.0% 127.4% 122.0% \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are predominantly from residents of the Baltics.

As at 31 March 2020 the own funds of Luminor were 1 598 million EUR and \\r\\nas at 31 December 2019 they were 1 572 million EUR, and they were fully composed of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn its Capital Adequacy calculations Luminor uses the standardised method to calculate risk weighted exposure amounts for credit \\r\\nrisk and market risk. Risk weighted exposure amounts for operational risk are calculated using the Basic Indicator Approach method. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 March 2020, the Leverage Ratio, calculated in accordance with the CRR, was 11.5%, and as at 31 December 2019 it was \\r\\n10.9%. The leverage ratio is calculated as total Tier 1 own funds divided by the total risk exposure measure, including the risk position \\r\\non assets and off-balance-sheet liabilities. \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital ratios  \\r\\n\\r\\nPosition Q1  2020 Q4  2019 Q3  2019 Q2 2019 Q1  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeverage Ratio 11.46% 10.88% 10.89% 10.59% 12.00% \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 Ratio 20.54% 19.66% 18.73% 17.99% 20.02% \\r\\n\\r\\nT1 Capital Ratio 20.54% 19.66%   18.73% 17.99% 20.02% \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Capital Ratio 20.54% 19.66% 18.73% 17.99% 20.02% \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n1.1%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.0%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.9% 1.2%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.3% 0.4%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.1%0.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.4%\\r\\n\\r\\nBaltic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOther EU Non-EU \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 19  \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the prudential requirements, the Pillar 2 requirement set by the ECB in the 2019 Joint Decision on Capital and the \\r\\nSystemic risk and Countercyclical risk buffer requirements set by the Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian regulators, Luminor Group is \\r\\nrequired to hold capital exceeding 10.8% CET1 and 15.2% Total capital.

capital. The bonus share issue is \\r\\nbased on the bank’s interim balance sheet as of January 2, 2019 and involves a partial conversion of share premium in the amount of 216 030 920 EUR \\r\\ninto share capital. Following the bonus issue, the share capital of the bank has been reduced by the same amount and was paid out to the shareholders \\r\\nin September 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 25  \\r\\n\\r\\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Notes Q1 2020 Q1 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flows from operating activities       \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit before tax   -18 965 28 010 \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustment for:       \\r\\n\\r\\n-Net impairment (losses)/ reversal on loans to customers  11 26 411 -7 276 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Dividend income   -18 -29 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Share of profit from an associate   -311 -214 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Loss/(profit) from foreign currency revaluation   124 235 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Depreciation, amortisation and impairment   2 990 3 571 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Other adjustments   1 674 -301 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Interest income  4 -70 624 -74 550 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Interest expenses  4 16 544 10 736 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from operations before changes in operating assets/liabilities   -42 175 -39 818 \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in operating assets/liabilities       \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of lending to customers   269 868 211 118 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of other assets   -4 740 5 736 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (+) / decrease (-) of client deposits   -984 064 -1 221 607 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of liabilities   12 211 8 904 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest received   69 543 65 233 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest paid   -16 971 -18 981 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncome tax paid   -2 840 -1 394 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from operating activites   -656 993 -950 991 \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nInvesting activities       \\r\\n\\r\\nAcquisition of property and equipment and intangible assets   -979 -2 632 \\r\\n\\r\\nAcquisition of investment property  0 800 \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from disposal of property and equipment and intangible assets  625 8 401 \\r\\n\\r\\nDividend received   18 29 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from investing activities   -336 6 598 \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancing activities       \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued   503 313 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments of principal on leases   -670 -811 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flows from financing activities   502 643 -811 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 26  \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents   -196 861 -985 022 \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period  8,9 2 952 815 3 310 517 \\r\\n\\r\\nEffects of currency translation on cash and cash equivalents   -124 -235 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents   -196 861 -985 022 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period   2 755 830 2 325 260 \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents comprises       \\r\\n\\r\\nCash on hand  8 135 955 171 779 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-restricted  current account  with central bank  8 2 510 860 2 005 235 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions on demand or with original maturity of three months or \\r\\nless \\r\\n\\r\\n 9 109 015 148 246 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   2 755 830 2 325 260 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 27  \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL \\r\\nSTATEMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\n1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE INFORMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) is a local credit institution whose parent company is Luminor Holding AS that is \\r\\nultimately controlled by BCP VII, an investment fund managed by an affiliate of Blackstone Group Inc. Other shareholders of Luminor \\r\\nHolding AS - Nordea Bank Abp and DNB BANK ASA - are considered to be the entities with significant influence over the Group. The \\r\\nLuminor Bank’s registered legal address is Liivalaia 45, 10145, Tallinn, Republic of Estonia. \\r\\n\\r\\nNew company Luminor Holding AS, established on the 14th of May 2019, is the new parent company of Luminor Bank AS since 23 \\r\\nSeptember 2019. Until 23 September 2019 the parent company was Luminor Group AB. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor Bank AS has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries through \\r\\nthe Estonian registered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone acquired a 60.1% majority stake in the Luminor \\r\\nHolding AS, the owner of Luminor Bank AS. Luminor Bank AS previous owners, Nordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB BANK ASA \\r\\n(\"DNB\"), each retained a 19.95% equity stake in the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current interim report, “Bank” (or Luminor Bank AS) refers to Luminor Bank AS. “Group” refers to the consolidated financial \\r\\nstatements of Luminor Bank AS and its subsidiaries.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 March 2020 Luminor Bank AS directly or indirectly owned majority in the following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\nRepublic of Estonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country  \\r\\nRepublic of Latvia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\nRepublic of Lithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Liising AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Pensions Estonia AS \\r\\n\\r\\n• Promano Estonia OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Asset Management IPAS \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Finance SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Līzings SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Realm SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Salvus SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Salvus 2 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Salvus 3 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Salvus 4 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Salvus 6 SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Trioleta SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Baltic ipasums SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Industrius UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n• Intractus UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n• Promano Lit UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n• Recurso UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Investiciju \\r\\nValdymas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Lizingas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n• Gėlužės projektai UAB \\r\\n(under liquidation) \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 March 2020 Luminor Bank AS had ownership in the following associated companies (25%): \\r\\n\\r\\n• ALD Automotive AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n• ALD Automotive SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n• ALD Automotive UAB  \\r\\n\\r\\n• SIA Kredītinformācijas Birojs \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 28  \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) was prepared in \\r\\naccordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed consolidated interim financial \\r\\ninformation does not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in \\r\\nconjunction with the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are consistent with \\r\\nthose followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, except \\r\\nfor the adoption of new standards effective as of 1 January 2020. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or \\r\\namendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. Several amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2020, but \\r\\ndo not have a material impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.   \\r\\n\\r\\nGroup decided to present financial information in interim report at the same format as  it was presented in  the annual financial \\r\\nstatements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019, therefore  comparative data for the period Q1 2019 has been \\r\\nupdated accordingly. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and applies assumptions that affect the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements and \\r\\nthe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s \\r\\nexperience and expectations of future events. In the first quarter of the 2020 global COVID-19 pandemic affected many economies, \\r\\nindividuals and companies and thus also required Luminor to react and make certain judgements which inter alia had the effect on the \\r\\nimpairment amounts. \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognizes credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The Standard applies a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) \\r\\napproach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at \\r\\nfair value through profit or loss (FVPL), together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The assets to test for \\r\\nimpairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes assets where there has been \\r\\nno significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or which are classified as low credit risk (credit rating indicating investment \\r\\ngrade). The allowances for stage 1 assets are based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default in the next \\r\\ntwelve months (12-month expected credit loss). Stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk. The \\r\\nallowances for stage 2 assets are based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default over the life of the asset \\r\\n(lifetime expected credit losses). Stage 3 includes credit-impaired (defaulted) assets, and the allowances reflect the lifetime expected \\r\\ncredit losses. Material assets in stage 3 are tested for impairment on an individual basis, while for immaterial stage 3 assets a collective \\r\\nassessment is performed. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for additional category - \\r\\npurchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) - regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable \\r\\ninputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include: \\r\\n\\r\\n• evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2; identification \\r\\nof unlikely to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3; \\r\\n\\r\\n• classification of forbearance and Watch list; \\r\\n\\r\\n• assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including the \\r\\nvarious formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\r\\n• the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and \\r\\nexposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\r\\n• determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic and \\r\\npessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 29  \\r\\n\\r\\n• estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and assigning \\r\\nprobabilities to those scenarios; \\r\\n\\r\\n• setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe model applied (including triggers for significant increase in credit risk) was not changed in the first quarter of 2020. The \\r\\nmacroeconomic parameters were reviewed to reflect the outlook due to COVID-19.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMore qualitative and quantitative information on an impairment of financial assets in light of COVID-19 is provided in Note 3 General \\r\\nRisk Management Policies. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from \\r\\nactive markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The input to \\r\\nthese models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in \\r\\nestablishing fair values. For the fair value of financial assets and liabilities refer to Note 17. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nMAIN GOALS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of risk management at Luminor is to achieve an optimal balance between the risk of losses and the earnings potential in a \\r\\nmedium- and long-term perspective.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor Risk Management function is organised in order to ensure efficient and effective risk management and full implementation \\r\\nof the principles and requirements outlined in Luminor’s Risk Policy and Strategy.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk management principles are the following: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Risk Accountability: every area in the Group is accountable for the risks arising from their activities; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Risk Identification, Assessment, Measurement, Monitoring, Mitigation and Reporting: all material exposures must be identified, \\r\\nassessed, managed and reported in a timely and accurate manner; \\r\\n\\r\\n• The Group shall have a conservative overall risk profile and only assume risk which Luminor is able to identify, assess, manage \\r\\nand monitor; \\r\\n\\r\\n• The Group is committed not to offer products or services or perform other acts which entail a risk of contributing to unethical \\r\\nconduct, infringement of human or labour rights, corruption or serious environmental harm. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group maintains a Recovery Plan following the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive adopted by the European Parliament. The \\r\\nplan serves as one of Luminor’s key risk management tools and ensures procedures for restoration of the Group’s solvency following \\r\\nsituations of severe stress without any involvement by or support from the authorities or taxpayers. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s risk appetite in general is low. The Group assesses its capital and liquidity adequacy on an ongoing basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group analyses, evaluates, accepts and manages the risks or combinations of risks to which it is exposed to. The most important \\r\\ntypes of risk the Group is exposed to are solvency risk, credit risk, model risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational \\r\\nrisk, and  business model risk. Concentration risk is assessed as part of the credit risk, other types of concentration risk are assessed to \\r\\nbe less material for the Group. Market risk includes foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. Operational risk includes also \\r\\ncompliance, fraud and financial crime, business continuity and IT stability risks, as well as risks related to cyber- and information \\r\\nsecurity.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the light of COVID-19 epidemic developments in Europe, the ECB-led Comprehensive Assessment (i.e. both the Asset Quality Review \\r\\nand Stress Test exercises) has been put on hold until further notice. The ECB will inform Luminor when the new information on revised \\r\\ndates and timelines is available. Luminor has reprioritized its strategic activities for year 2020 accordingly and is focusing on a COVID-\\r\\n19 impact assessment and performs institution-wide stress tests under COVID-19 affected macroeconomic scenarios and financial \\r\\nshocks. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 30  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk management in the Group is organised in such a way that any possible conflicts of interest are avoided or escalated. \\r\\n\\r\\nOrganisational Structure of the Risk Management function: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Enterprise Risk Department is a centralized center of expertise and manages risk management tools and processes which run across \\r\\ndifferent risk types. The control function for operational risk lies under the responsibility of the Operational Risk Department. The \\r\\nMarket & Liquidity Risk  Department is responsible for market risk and liquidity risk control. The control function for credit risk is split \\r\\nunder the responsibility of the Credit Risk Department and Credit Risk Quantification Department. The Model Risk & Validation \\r\\nDepartment owns the model risk framework and respective validation activities. The Risk Programmes: CA & IRB Department and Risk \\r\\nTransformation Department drive Luminor’s development and further improvement of risk management. The Risk division is part of \\r\\nthe second line of defence and the organisational departments within the Risk division report directly to the Group Chief Risk Officer \\r\\n(CRO).  \\r\\n\\r\\nRisk management processes and the effectiveness of internal control are assessed by the Internal Audit function (third line of defence). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe internal control framework – as a system of organisational measures, actions covering the whole Luminor Group, including the \\r\\nManagement’s responsibilities and tasks, and the activities of all business lines and internal units, including internal control functions, \\r\\noutsourced activities and distribution channels and internal procedures – ensures the effective and efficient operations and prudent \\r\\nconduct of business, compliance with laws, regulations, supervisory requirements and Luminor’s internal policies, the adequate and \\r\\ncontinuous identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of risks, the sound administrative and \\r\\naccounting procedures as well as the reliability of financial and non-financial information and submission thereof in a timely manner. \\r\\nThe Management Board is responsible for establishing and monitoring the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control system and \\r\\nfor overseeing all business lines and internal units in the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Management Board and/or Supervisory Council approve the most important policies and strategies comprising the Group’s risk \\r\\nmanagement framework.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supervisory Council Risk Committee advises the Supervisory Council regarding the setting and monitoring of risk appetite, strategy \\r\\nand further matters related to risk management. The Supervisory Council Risk Committee raises concerns and warns, where \\r\\nappropriate, when specific developments materially affect or may affect Luminor’s risk profile.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Credit Committee is a decision-making body regarding individual credit cases and contributes to the development of a sound and \\r\\nuniform credit culture in the Group. The Credit Committee provides recommendations regarding important credit regulations. \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures imposed by most of the European countries had an adverse impact on economies \\r\\nin the first quarter of 2020. Luminor has been monitoring the spread of COVID-19 since early 2020 and was preparing to adjust its risk \\r\\nmanagement to the new reality. The impact on different types of risks is disclosed further below. \\r\\n\\r\\nCREDIT RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit risk is defined as the risk for the Group to incur losses due to customers’ failure to fulfil their financial obligations towards the \\r\\nGroup. Credit exposures arise primarily in lending activities, including from off-balance sheet financial instruments, such as loan \\r\\ncommitments, guarantees and letters of credit. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe key principles of Luminor’s credit risk management are outlined in the Group Credit Policy, Credit Strategy for Legal Entities and \\r\\nCredit Strategy for Private Individuals. Practical aspects of the application of the principles set out in these documents, and decision-\\r\\nmaking processes are regulated by the Credit Manual for Legal Entities and Credit Manual for Private Individuals. \\r\\n\\r\\nGroup Chief Risk \\r\\nOfficer\\r\\n\\r\\nEnterprise Risk\\r\\nOperational \\r\\n\\r\\nRisk\\r\\nMarket & \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity Risk\\r\\nCredit Risk\\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Risk \\r\\nQuantification\\r\\n\\r\\nModel Risk & \\r\\nInternal \\r\\n\\r\\nValidation\\r\\n\\r\\nRisk \\r\\nProgrammes: \\r\\n\\r\\nCA & IRB\\r\\n\\r\\nRisk \\r\\nTransformation\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 31  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe spread of the COVID-19 is a global tragedy that requires governments, private businesses, and all citizens to work together and \\r\\nfight this disease and its consequences. In a first instance, this has required governments across Europe and also in the Baltic states to \\r\\nimpose significant constraints on social- and economic life to slow the spread of the disease, avoid overburdening of the health care \\r\\nsystem, and by doing so saving lives. These social- and economic constraints carry high costs, because they imply a significant reduction \\r\\nof economic activity, including businesses being almost entirely shut down in certain sectors, and strongly increasing unemployment \\r\\nas a consequence. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince Luminor is one of the largest banks in the Baltic region, many of Luminor’s customers are directly or indirectly affected by this \\r\\nsituation, some of our customers are severely affected. We in Luminor feel therefore strongly that we need to play as constructive role \\r\\nas possible to support our customers during this time of need and to serve the Baltic states and communities by securing a robust and \\r\\nstable financial system and robust and stable financial services. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis also requires from Luminor to extend additional support and additional solutions to our customers in order to make sure that our \\r\\ncustomers get through this difficult period as well as possible. On the other hand, Luminor is also charged with the responsibility to \\r\\nprotect Luminor’s depositors, and to make sure that Luminor’s balance sheet and the Baltic financial system do not become \\r\\noverburdened by businesses for which there is no outlook of recovering from this crisis into a sound and viable business. These \\r\\ncustomers need to be significantly restructured, and in cases where even that is no longer feasible, some businesses might have to be \\r\\nwound down in an orderly manner. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to be able to appropriately work with customers and manage COVID-19 related credit risks, the Group prepared a dedicated \\r\\n“COVID-19 Manual” for Legal Entities. Luminor’s general focus on our customers’ ability and willingness to perform their financial \\r\\nobligations is maintained. When considering modifications, particular emphasis is put on whether deteriorations are triggered by the \\r\\nexternal COVID-19 shock and a robust recovery is expected afterwards. Luminor’s standard approach and procedures are applied if \\r\\ndeteriorations started already before COVID-19 or deteriorations are not related to COVID-19. The industry in which the customer \\r\\noperates, the fact whether Luminor is the main lender, and the type of credit product also play a role. In case of new lending, the \\r\\nfinancial ability to serve the credit remains a key aspect. For individual customers payment holidays on principal payments for a limited \\r\\nperiod of time might be granted either automatically if certain predefined conditions are met or through performing individual \\r\\nassessments. By the end of first quarter 2020 no industry-wide private moratoria which would comply with the European Banking \\r\\nAuthority’s (the EBA) Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria on loan repayments applied in the light of the COVID-19 \\r\\ncrisis were in place. \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit decisions are made by Credit Committees and authorised individuals according to defined powers to act, which are risk adjusted. \\r\\nThe decision of the Credit Committee must be unanimous. Powers to act for individuals (Credit Officers and persons from Sales, \\r\\nRestructuring & Recovery) are personal and based on competence level. Some extent of flexibility for decision taking on “automatic” \\r\\nchanges was introduced to be able to handle more customer requests for modifications. \\r\\n\\r\\nModifications and forbearances \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has defined standard modification solutions for COVID-19 affected customers. For individual customers standard/automatic \\r\\ngrace period for principal payments is granted if the customer had acceptable payment history (no more than 21 days overdue during \\r\\nlast 12 months): up to 6 months for mortgage loans, up to 3 months for consumer loans and leasing agreements. For business customers \\r\\nsolutions are also product specific. For commercial loans, a grace period up to 6 months is granted for low and medium risk level \\r\\ncustomers. For leasing agreements, a grace period up to 3 months is possible, if the leasing object is a passenger car and historical \\r\\noverdues during the last 12 months did not exceed 15 days; and for low and medium risk transportation sector entities where exposure \\r\\ndoes not exceed 2 million EUR and historical overdues and trends in historical financial results evidence that difficulties are purely \\r\\nCOVID-19 related. \\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual evaluation of modification requests is performed for all other cases. For COVID-19 affected customers the state support \\r\\nprogrammes or state guarantees are used whenever feasible. \\r\\n\\r\\nForbearance treatment in essence is kept unchanged, the integral condition is financial difficulties. Currently the modification is not \\r\\nclassified as forbearance if  \\r\\n\\r\\n• individual customers have good payment history and acceptable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, meaning overdues below 21 days \\r\\nduring last 12 months and LTV below 85 per cent; \\r\\n\\r\\n• business customers are considered low and medium risk, taking into account the combination of financial risk and industry risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nBesides regular reports prepared and presented to the Group’s management bodies to follow the level and developments of the \\r\\nassumed credit risk, specific COVID-19 related reports are being prepared which are also shared with the ECB. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 32  \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment policies \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognises credit losses in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. IFRS applies a forward-looking expected credit loss \\r\\n(ECL) approach. For more detailed information on the impairment policies, please refer to Note 5 General Risk Management Policies of \\r\\nthe Luminor Bank AS Annual Report 2019. In the first quarter of 2020 the impairment methodology remained unchanged. \\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent authorities – the ECB, EBA, European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), IFRS Foundation, Basel Committee on Banking \\r\\nSupervision (BCBS) – have announced various measures to deal with the crisis and minimise the effect on the economies. The Group \\r\\nacts in line with above mentioned institutions’ guidance in regards of ECL. The modifications granted for COVID-19 affected customers \\r\\ndo not automatically indicate Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR), nor classification to forbearance or default status. However, the \\r\\nobligation to assess for unlikeliness to pay (which consequently triggers default status) remains in place. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe set of SICR triggers was not changed: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Significant increase of lifetime PD – significant increase of lifetime PD since initial recognition until the reporting date (2.5 times \\r\\nand 0.6 p.p. jointly); \\r\\n\\r\\n• Risk grade 9 or 10 – risk grade 9 or 10 as at the reporting date; \\r\\n\\r\\n• >30 days past due – more than 30 days past due as at the reporting date; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Forborne performing – forborne performing status as at the reporting date (forbearance not triggering non-performing status) \\r\\nin accordance with FINREP instruction reporting requirements; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Watch list – watch list status as at the reporting date. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nIf at least one of the above SICR indicators is identified after initial recognition of the financial instrument and was not present as of its \\r\\norigination the financial asset is treated as facing a significant increase in credit risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nThree macroeconomic variables - annual change in real GDP, unemployment rate and annual change of residential real estate price - \\r\\nare included in the PD and LGD estimation modelling for the individual customers segment and two of them – annual change in real \\r\\nGDP together with unemployment rate – are used for PD and LGD estimation modelling in case of the business customers segment. \\r\\nThe following tables show the parameters that were used for macroeconomic modelling as at 31 March 2020 and 31 December 2019. \\r\\nFor the first quarter of 2020 the forecasts of macroeconomic variables were updated by Luminor macroeconomists at the end of March \\r\\n2020 with projections and assumptions over three years. Following the ECB guidance, excessively procyclical forecasts were avoided \\r\\nassuming not only the nearest short-term downturn (the first year) but also the recovery period in the market after that (the second \\r\\nand the third year). Starting from the fourth year it is assumed that risk parameters (PD and LGD) converge to their long-term average \\r\\nlevels (estimated over the cycle). \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 33  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic variables Optimistic scenario Baseline scenario (realistic) Pessimistic scenario \\r\\n\\r\\n Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for scenario, % 30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real GDP, % 3.2 4.5 4.7 -3.3 3.1 2.8 -3.6 -1.1 2.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, % 6.1 5.9 4.8 7.1 7.7 6.2 11.0 10.7 10.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of residential real \\r\\n\\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n7.4 8.4 6.8 -5.2 6.3 7.1 -16.5 -8.6 1.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvia \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic variables Optimistic scenario Baseline scenario (realistic) Pessimistic scenario \\r\\n\\r\\n Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for scenario, % 30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real GDP, % 1.5 5.3 3.6 -1.8 5.5 2.5 -5.6 1.7 1.6 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, % 8.5 6.8 5.0 9.3 8.0 6.4 12.4 11.7 10.1 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of residential real \\r\\n\\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n3.0 5.0 8.0 -4.0 3.0 6.0 -12.0 -7.0 1.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nLithuania \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic variables Optimistic scenario Baseline scenario (realistic) Pessimistic scenario \\r\\n\\r\\n Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for scenario, % 30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real GDP, % 1.6 4.5 4.0 -1.9 5.0 3.2 -4.3 1.0 2.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, % 7.8 5.6 4.8 8.5 7.0 6.0 11.8 10.7 9.9 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of residential real \\r\\n\\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n4.0 8.0 6.5 -4.0 8.0 5.0 -19.0 -5.0 2.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 34  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic variables Optimistic scenario Baseline scenario (realistic) Pessimistic scenario \\r\\n\\r\\n Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for scenario, % 30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real GDP, % 4.2 3.5 3.2 2.7 2.3 2.1 -3.1 -1.1 2.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, % 5.0 4.9 4.8 5.7 6.1 6.2 11.0 10.7 10.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of residential real \\r\\n\\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n9.0 7.2 5.8 4.1 3.2 3.1 -16.5 -8.6 1.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvia \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic variables Optimistic scenario Baseline scenario (realistic) Pessimistic scenario \\r\\n\\r\\n Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for scenario, % 30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real GDP, % 3.4 4.1 4.7 1.9 3.0 4.2 -3.0 -0.6 3.2 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, % 5.7 5.2 4.7 6.2 5.9 5.4 9.4 10.3 9.6 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of residential real \\r\\n\\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n7.0 8.0 8.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 -7.0 -4.0 -1.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nLithuania \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic variables Optimistic scenario Baseline scenario (realistic) Pessimistic scenario \\r\\n\\r\\n Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for scenario, % 30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real GDP, % 4.2 3.8 4.0 2.8 2.4 2.5 -2.0 -1.6 1.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, % 6.2 5.8 5.5 6.5 6.7 6.8 8.8 10.2 9.5 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of residential real \\r\\n\\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n9.0 6.0 6.0 5 3 3 -8.0 -2.0 4.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAsset quality \\r\\n\\r\\nThe adverse impact of COVID-19 is reflected in asset quality of Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most severe consequences will most probably be seen in industries like accommodation, tourism, and aviation. Even though \\r\\nLuminor’s portfolio towards these economic sectors is relatively small, negative trends in the portfolio are still observed since many \\r\\nother industries are quite severely affected as well. As a result, requests for modifications (including grace period) reached 0.9 billion \\r\\nEUR at the end of March 2020 and exceeded 1.1 billion EUR (11% of the total credit portfolio) by the middle of April 2020.  \\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the situation, and the generous terms for modifications, the number of modifications has been limited so far.  \\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 70% of modification requests came from business customers. Earlier applications for modification from business \\r\\ncustomers compared to individual customers can be explained by the following reasons: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 35  \\r\\n\\r\\n• business customers have been affected first; moreover, professional financial management leads business customers to \\r\\n\\r\\nimmediately approach the bank, if foreseeing the need for modifications;  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n• individual customers often have unemployment benefits. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest part of modification requests from business customers are for industries like real estate activities, transportation and \\r\\nstorage, wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common modification type is grace period on principal payments. Luminor is restrictive (applying only exceptionally) towards \\r\\ngranting full grace period (including grace on interest payments). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe volume of overdue loans is fluctuating and not yet showing negative trends, however, depending on the development of the \\r\\npandemic and measures taken by governments, this might accelerate in the second quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal exposure and respective allowances distribution by Stages is provided further below in this note. \\r\\n\\r\\nMaximum exposure to credit risk before collateral held or other credit enhancements \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is reflected in the carrying amounts of financial assets in the consolidated statement of \\r\\nfinancial position.

Approximately 60% of total impairments during the first quarter of 2020 were made for individually assessed \\r\\nStage 3 exposures, of which 30% are related to the largest non-performing customer and oil price shock, 60% are for new non-\\r\\nperforming customers and 10% are due to reviewed assumptions for existing non-performing customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe remainder of the change in allowances for impairment is explained by the change of macroeconomic scenarios for Stage 1 and \\r\\nStage 2 impairment, Stage 2 portfolio increase and due to higher observed default frequencies compared to modelled PDs. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 38  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal

institutions mainly comprise nostro and custody cash account balances with Luminor \\r\\ncorrespondent banks.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAll banks are risk classified and risk limits are established. In case the external rating for a bank is not available a conservative expert \\r\\njudgment serves as basis for the Group internal rating, which reflects the bank’s credit strength, derived from macroeconomic factors \\r\\nand bank’s own solvency and liquidity factors, together with qualitative non-financial adjustments. The internal risk grade and \\r\\nprobability of default (PD) of banks is based on the available risk classifications from rating agencies Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and \\r\\nFitch.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Luminor a separate dedicated Financial Institutions unit acts as a single core competence center and ensures holistic overview of the \\r\\nGroup’s credit limits/exposure on banks and countries. Since March 2020, the Financial Institutions unit has switched from quarterly \\r\\nto daily portfolio monitoring. A Financial Institutions Credit Commitee is organised on a regular basis to follow-up the latest market \\r\\ndevelopments and review if any changes/restrictions are needed for established credit limits towards banks and countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\n The Group’s portfolio consists of reputable investment grade correspondent banks that have not experienced credit rating downgrades \\r\\nduring the first quarter of 2020 and from COVID-19, except one counterpart bank that has been downgraded by one notch, but is still \\r\\non BBB level. \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities exposure of the Group at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was 258.5 million EUR compared to 223.8 million EUR at \\r\\nthe end of 2019. The credit risk arising from these securities is evaluated with a separate metric, but overall exposure is limited, as most \\r\\nof these debt securities are issued by the governments of Lithuania and Latvia. The remaining part consists of international bonds \\r\\nguaranteed by France, Belgium and Luxembourg governments, Austria sovereign bonds, which are all treated as level 1 assets in the \\r\\nLCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) calculation, and a minor position of Lithuanian corporate bonds. The average weighted duration of the \\r\\ntotal portfolio is 3 years compared to 3.1 at the end of 2019. Debt securities investments are performed in accordance with the limits \\r\\nset by Luminor’s Management Board and the Supervisory Council. Limit utilization is monitored on daily basis. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 58  \\r\\n\\r\\nMARKET RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has a low risk appetite for market risk, which is defined as the risk of losses in on- and off-balance sheet positions arising \\r\\nfrom adverse movements in market parameters such as interest rates (interest rate risk), credit spreads (credit spread risk), currency \\r\\nexchange rates (foreign exchange or FX risk), equity prices (equity price risk) or commodity prices (commodity price risk). The most \\r\\nsignificant parts of the market risk for the Group are interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange risk, while the significance \\r\\nof other risks is lower.  \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate risk is assessed using the basis-point-value (BPV) method, which measures the impact on the value of net cash flows from \\r\\na one basis point (0.01%) parallel shift in market interest rates. The BPV calculations are performed on a regular basis and submitted \\r\\nto the Group’s Management.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit spread risk is evaluated analysing the bank’s consolidated bond portfolio, including liquidity bond portfolio managed by Treasury \\r\\nand Asset and Liability Management Department, trading bond portfolio managed by Markets Department’s Fixed Income desk and \\r\\ndebt securities owned by separate entities within the Group if any. Changes in the credit spreads for debt instruments are estimated \\r\\nevaluating bond credit rating, asset liquidity, interest rates, default history if any.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrency risk (foreign exchange or FX risk) is evaluated calculating open foreign exchange positions on Group level.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll the above risks are limited by the Risk Appetite Framework and/or lower level limits monitored on a regular basis. Additionally, \\r\\nderivative transactions from operations of Markets Department can only be performed on back-to-back basis. Therefore, the Group’s \\r\\noverall exposure towards market risk remains low. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to the spread of the novel corona virus COVID-19, the major negative impact to the Group in terms of market risk could \\r\\narise from credit spread risk. This risk is mitigated by limits as well as certain quality requirements for the bond portfolios. The potential \\r\\nimpact of the credit spread risk is disclosed in the corresponding section below considering stress assumptions. \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket risk measurement approaches \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is mainly focused on the management of interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange risk, which are, as outlined \\r\\nabove, the most significant risks.   \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate risk is assessed as the impact of a yield curve parallel shift on the present value of the gap between total assets and total \\r\\nliabilities. In general, assets have longer maturities than liabilities, which creates risks due to open interest rate positions. Therefore, \\r\\ninterbank funding is attracted to decrease the discrepancy between long and short terms. In addition to this, interest rate swaps are \\r\\nused to achieve and maintain an acceptable level of interest rate risk on total level, on currency level and within individual time bands. \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit spread risk for the Group arises from debt securities in the liquidity bond portfolio (sovereign and covered bonds) and exposures \\r\\nin the trading debt portfolio mostly consisting of sovereign and corporate debt. The Group measures the stressed spread impact to its \\r\\nliquidity bond portfolio only due to materiality, assuming a 100 basis points spread widening towards risk-free alternative investments \\r\\nof matching maturity profile for A-rated bonds and a 50 basis points spread widening for corresponding AA-rated bonds. \\r\\n\\r\\nFX risk is assessed as an open position between assets and liabilities for a respective currency. Open positions for all currencies in the \\r\\nGroup are restricted by the limits set by the Luminor’s Management Board and the Supervisory Council, and monitored on a daily basis.  \\r\\n\\r\\nINTEREST RATE RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main source of interest rate risk in the Group is the repricing risk – risk related to the timing mismatch in the maturity and repricing \\r\\nof assets and liabilities of on- and off-balance sheet positions. Pursuant to Luminor’s Market Risk Policy, interest rate risk is limited in \\r\\nterms of basis point value (BPV), i.e. the change in net cash flows (gaps) given a one basis point (0.01%) parallel shift in the market \\r\\ninterest rates. Separate limits for banking and trading activities are approved by the Management Board and the Supervisory Council \\r\\nof Luminor Bank AS, as well as limits for different currencies: EUR, USD, NOK and sum of all other currencies. When calculating the total \\r\\nexposure the sums of BPV in each currency are aggregated irrespective if the total exposure in each individual currency is a short or \\r\\nlong position, i.e. netting of positions between currencies is not allowed. The main part of the interest rate risk arises from the positions \\r\\nthat are denominated in EUR. Using derivatives as hedges is a major part of interest risk management, please also refer to Note 10. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk from changes in interest rates increases for longer duration time buckets due to higher uncertainty of future rates. To limit risk \\r\\nexposure resulting from different time buckets, so-called gapping limits are determined for each of them. Limit established for each \\r\\ntime bucket is defined as a percentage of the total BPV limit allocated to the relevant currency. All time buckets till one year period are \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 59  \\r\\n\\r\\nlimited to 100% of total BPV, 1-2 years gap is limited to 120% of total BPV, and all time buckets above 2 years are limited to 150% of \\r\\ntotal BPV. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s BPV exposure by currencies for both trading and banking activities (thousand EUR):  \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrency 31 March 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nEUR -25 299 -41 291 \\r\\n\\r\\nUSD 3 587 4 965 \\r\\n\\r\\nNOK 331 727 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther currencies -340 -65 \\r\\n\\r\\nSensitivity to interest rate risk \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate risk exposure cannot exceed BPV limits approved by the Luminor’s Management Board and the Supervisory Council. \\r\\nAssuming a 200 basis points parallel shift of the yield curve, sensitivity of interest rate risk shall be calculated multiplying total BPV \\r\\nexposure by interest rate change. The above mentioned shift of the yield curve creates the following impact on the Group’s equity and \\r\\nprofit/loss (thousand EUR):  \\r\\n\\r\\n 31 March 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity 3 191 9 410 \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit/Loss 16 636 14 029 \\r\\n\\r\\nCREDIT SPREAD RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bank follows a rigorous framework for debt securities management. Bond portfolios managed by Treasury and Asset and Liability \\r\\nManagement and Markets Departments are restricted in size, level of quality, region available and counterparty, limiting credit risk \\r\\nexposure. However, the bank measures the stressed spread impact to its liquidity bond portfolio as part of the Risk Appetite Framework. \\r\\nAssuming a 100 basis points spread widening towards risk-free alternative investments of matching maturity profile for A-rated bonds \\r\\nand a 50 basis points spread widening for corresponding AA-rated bonds, the projected decrease in market value of the bonds would \\r\\nbe the following: \\r\\n\\r\\n 31 March 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket value loss projection due to increase in credit spreads 6.5 6.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE (FX) RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s main exposure is towards euro currency (EUR), while positions of other currencies are not significant. A conservative \\r\\napproach to FX risk is followed within the Group. It is measured as the nominal value of the open FX positions converted to EUR using \\r\\nthe ECB rates. The Group has both intraday and overnight limits. Some technical deviations from the limits are allowed only for a short \\r\\nterm when servicing customers. The Group has approved separate limits for the United States Dollar (USD), sum of other currencies, \\r\\nmax of other currencies and total currencies. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 60  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s exposure to FX risk (thousand EUR): \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrency 31 March 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nUSD 77 97 \\r\\n\\r\\nMax of other currencies* 97 302 \\r\\n\\r\\nSum of other currencies** 318 609 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal*** 307 383 \\r\\n\\r\\n*Max of other currencies – this represents the maximum absolute exposure of all foreign currencies other than USD. \\r\\n**Sum of other currencies – this represents the sum of all foreign currency exposures in absolute terms excluding USD. \\r\\n***Total – this represents the higher absolute value between sum of positive exposures and sum of negative exposures of all foreign currency open \\r\\npositions. \\r\\n\\r\\nSensitivity of foreign exchange risk \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bank applies value-at-risk (VaR) model for simulation of volatility parameters which are then applied to the actual open foreign \\r\\nexchange positions to evaluate loss projection. VaR model is set considering the 99 percent confidence level, assuming 10-day holding \\r\\nperiod and calibrated from at least 5-year long time series, including periods of market turbulence. Risk parameters for currencies other \\r\\nthan USD are increased by 50%. \\r\\n\\r\\nFX stress test under the above mentioned conditions indicates a possible loss of EUR 30 thousands as of the first quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nEQUITY AND COMMODITY RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group does not have any open position in commodity instruments, thus is not exposed to commodity price risk.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group does not have any open positions in equity instruments held for trading. However, the Group owns some shares on its \\r\\nbalance sheet which are recognized as participation in the settlement systems rather than any kind of investment in shares. The total \\r\\nvalue of these shares has increased over the year 2019 due to a positive trend of underlying instruments, thus, in accordance to external \\r\\naudit recommendations, equity instruments have been reclassified as debt securities at fair value through profit/loss. In terms of stress \\r\\ntest, a value-at-risk (VaR) model has been used with a 99% confidence level and 1 year holding period, whereas the horizon of data \\r\\nanalyzed includes the latest financial crisis in 2008-2009 and consists of at least 5 years of historical developments of share prices. The \\r\\nresulting shock applied to the total value of shares produced an outcome of possible loss equal to 2.1 million EUR as at the end of the \\r\\nfirst quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations in time, the risk of incurring losses due to \\r\\nthe sudden decrease in financial resources (e.g. a financial crisis situation may result in a delay of incoming payments) or an increase \\r\\nof the price of new resources for refinancing. The consequence of liquidity risk may be failure to meet obligations to repay depositors \\r\\nand fulfil loan commitments. The Group uses a range of liquidity metrics for measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk \\r\\nincluding the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) and internal liquidity limits. \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed to ensure a constant ability to settle contractual obligations. The Group has developed a set of early warning \\r\\nindicators for a timely identification of liquidity crises, and business and funding contingency funding plans to manage the Group’s \\r\\nliquidity during market disruptions. The liquidity risk management strategy is reviewed at least annually or after any significant change \\r\\nin the internal or external environment the Group operates in. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 61  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed across the three Lines of Defence: \\r\\n\\r\\n• The First Line of Defence comprises the Group’s Treasury and Asset and Liability Management (TALM) and the business areas. \\r\\nTALM is responsible for the daily liquidity management and funds transfer pricing (FTP). To ensure the funding in situations where \\r\\nLuminor is in urgent need of cash and the normal funding sources do not suffice, Luminor holds a liquidity buffer that consists of \\r\\ncentral bank cash and high quality securities that can be readily sold or used as collateral in funding operations;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Market and Liquidity Risk Department is the Second Line of Defence and is responsible for providing independent oversight and \\r\\ncontrol of liquidity risk and the First Line of Defence; \\r\\n\\r\\n• The Internal Audit function is the Third Line of Defence, which is responsible for providing independent assurance over the First \\r\\nand Second Lines of Defence activities. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk management is divided into long-term (1 year), short-term (1 week to 3 months) risk management and intraday liquidity \\r\\nmanagement. The aim of short-term liquidity management is to meet the daily need for funds to ensure compliance with the reserve \\r\\nand liquidity requirements set by the ECB, as well as compliance with internal liquidity limits. Short-term liquidity is maintained through \\r\\nthe daily monitoring of the liquidity status and day-to-day funding and trading the appropriate financial instruments for liquidity \\r\\npurposes. Long-term liquidity risk management is supported by analysing the estimated future cash flows taking into account deposit \\r\\nand loan portfolio growth, as well as possible refinancing sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of the liquidity risk assessment, the liquidity gap is analysed considering the maturity of cash flows. The liquidity risk is \\r\\nrestricted by imposing internal limits on the liquidity gap. Utilisation of this limit is subject to regular monitoring and reporting to \\r\\nmanagement bodies in the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity gap is calculated by analysing the Group’s net refinancing situation within one week, one month and three months applying \\r\\na \"business as usual\" approach. Liquid assets and short-term liabilities are included in liquidity gap calculation for respective terms (1 \\r\\nweek to 3 months). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Liquidity Coverage Ratio is calculated as the ratio of a credit institution’s liquidity buffer to its net liquidity outflows over a 30-\\r\\ncalendar-day stress period and is expressed as a percentage. The minimum regulatory limit of LCR is set at 100%, however the Group \\r\\nhas a substantial buffer and maintains a higher ratio. The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of the Group’s liquidity \\r\\nrisk profile and requires the holding of risk-free assets that may be easily liquidated to meet required payments for outflows net of \\r\\ninflows during a thirty-day crisis period without support from the central bank. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the

\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main funding source for Luminor are customer deposits. Since the creation of Luminor, the Bank has been funded by former parent \\r\\nbanks in the form of a syndicated loan. Taking into account Luminor’s plan to become an independent self-financed financial institution, \\r\\nparent funding will be gradually substituted by other sources of funding – from clients’ deposits to the funding received through capital \\r\\nmarkets. \\r\\n\\r\\nFunding tranches maturing in 2020 will be paid back or prolonged according to the terms of the Facility Agreement and Luminor’s \\r\\nfunding needs. Terms and conditions of the Facility Agreement – under which funding from former parents is provided – were modified \\r\\ndue to the changes of ownership in 2019. Due to the changes the commitment is partly or fully collateralized. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is defined as the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable \\r\\nfunding over a one-year time horizon. The minimum requirement for NSFR is 100%, however the Group has a substantial buffer and \\r\\nmaintains a higher ratio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has set the limits in place for various measures, including LCR, NSFR, liquidity gaps, and manages those within the set limits \\r\\nby ensuring the proper maturity structure of its assets and liabilities, for example, via issuing long dated debt. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 65  \\r\\n\\r\\nOff-balance sheet items \\r\\n\\r\\nThe analysis of nominal off-balance sheet items by remaining maturity is as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nOn demand and \\r\\n\\r\\nless than 1 month \\r\\n\\r\\n1-3 \\r\\n\\r\\nmonths \\r\\n\\r\\n3-12 \\r\\n\\r\\nmonths \\r\\n1-5 years \\r\\n\\r\\nOver 5 \\r\\n\\r\\nyears \\r\\nTOTAL \\r\\n\\r\\nLoan commitments 1 225 039 0 0 0 0 1 225 039 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial guarantees 110 226 0 0 0 0 110 226 \\r\\n\\r\\nPerformance guarantees 150 037 0 0 0 0 150 037 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther commitments* 398 246 0 0 0 0 398 246 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 1 883 548 0 0 0 0 1 883 548 \\r\\n\\r\\n* Other commitments given include different type of guarantees (warranty, payment and advance payment quarantees, etc)  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nOn demand and \\r\\n\\r\\nless than 1 \\r\\n\\r\\nmonth \\r\\n\\r\\n1-3 months 3-12 months 1-5 years Over 5 years TOTAL \\r\\n\\r\\nLoan \\r\\n\\r\\ncommitments \\r\\n1 134 434 0 0 0 0 1 134 434 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial \\r\\n\\r\\nguarantees \\r\\n110 655 0 0 0 0 110 655 \\r\\n\\r\\nPerformance \\r\\n\\r\\nguarantees \\r\\n74 647 0 0 0 0 74 647 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther \\r\\n\\r\\ncommitments* \\r\\n469 080 0 0 0 0 469 080 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 1 788 816 0 0 0 0 1 788 816 \\r\\n\\r\\n* Other commitments given include different type of guarantees ( warranty, payment and advance payment quarantees, etc)  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity buffer and collateral management \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a contractual agreement for funding in place with shareholders DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank Abp. This strongly \\r\\nmitigates the likelihood of funding liquidity risk which may be caused by deposit run off, wholesale funding risk (roll over and new \\r\\nissuance), unexpected outflows from off-balance sheet obligations and legal risks (e.g. not being able to issue funding due to legal \\r\\nrestrictions). As the Group is moving towards more reliance on self-funding rather than on support from shareholders, other funding \\r\\nsources are being established or are already in place for diversifying the funding base. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group is taking part in the ECB’s Eurosystem open market operations. In particular, the Group is a user of the ECB Targeted Long \\r\\nTerm Refinancing Operations (TLTRO). In addition, a significant part of funding is attracted through retail and corporate deposits. \\r\\nMoreover, the Group has already issued 650 million EUR of its own senior debt securities and 500 million EUR of covered bonds, and is \\r\\nconsidering to increase this amount in the future even more, which would further diversify the funding opportunities. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main part of the liquidity buffer is held with the Central Bank Accounts where the Group held 2.6 billion EUR at the end of March \\r\\n2020. This buffer can be utilized at any time when the need arises. \\r\\n\\r\\nSurvival horizon \\r\\n\\r\\nThe survival horizon indicator within the Risk Appetite Framework captures the liquidity buffer available outright to be used in liquidity \\r\\nstress situations within 12 months. It can also be described as the availability of liquidity which obviates the need to take any \\r\\nextraordinary measures.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThree different scenarios are considered while measuring survival horizon: bank-specific, market-wide and the combination of the most \\r\\nsevere assumptions from the previous two. Stress testing assumptions include but are not limited to severe deposit withdrawals, \\r\\nincluding early termination of term deposits and run-off of top 5 depositors, deterioration of financial assets, decrease of loan \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 66  \\r\\n\\r\\nrepayment levels, increase of utilization of credit commitments, availability of credit lines from shareholders based on facility \\r\\nagreements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity buffer for the survival horizon indicator is strongly affected by the assumption of outgoing deposits in the first few days \\r\\nand weeks of the turbulence period, with the smaller continuous run-off occurring in the following months. Due to rather high \\r\\nconcentration of top depositors, the Group tests resistance towards a run-off of the 5 largest depositors as well. However, Luminor has \\r\\nsubstantial unused credit line from shareholders which can be utilized any time based on the mutual facilities agreement. Furthermore, \\r\\nthe majority of liquid assets are held with central banks in the form of cash. The previous mentioned agreement and considerable \\r\\nvolume of highly liquid assets substantially softens the consequences of deteriorating liquidity in case of high outflows.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s liquidity situation is sufficiently strong to survive severe external shocks. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 67  \\r\\n\\r\\nEconomic sectors \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following tables break down Loans to customers at their carrying amounts  as categorised by the economic sectors of our \\r\\ncounterparties.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and loans to central bank, credit institutions, and customers \\r\\n\\r\\nGroup \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n31 March 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash on Hand 135 955 140 518 \\r\\n\\r\\nCentral Banks 2 619 986 2 783 501 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 109 048 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Institutions 13 894 29 255 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic Sector 156 307 174 715 \\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual Customer 5 529 350 5 606 413 \\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness Customers 4 228 346 4 412 164 \\r\\n\\r\\nAgriculture, forestry and fishing 318 874 337 080 \\r\\n\\r\\nMining and quarrying 15 818 23 658 \\r\\n\\r\\nManufacturing 527 550 571 675 \\r\\n\\r\\nElectricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply 123 435 132 176 \\r\\n\\r\\nWater supply 29 962 31 948 \\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction 191 166 197 785 \\r\\n\\r\\nWholesale and retail trade 834 168 937 197 \\r\\n\\r\\nTransport and storage 405 822 394 660 \\r\\n\\r\\nAccommodation and food service activities 44 307 48 768 \\r\\n\\r\\nInformation and communication 23 639 26 558 \\r\\n\\r\\nReal estate activities 1 114 141 1 132 767 \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessional, scientific and technical activities 229 120 210 089 \\r\\n\\r\\nAdministrative and support service activities 211 697 209 227 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic administration and defence, compulsory social security 4 780 5 358 \\r\\n\\r\\nEducation 6 526 7 106 \\r\\n\\r\\nHuman health services and social work activities 21 793 21 432 \\r\\n\\r\\nArts, entertainment and recreation 12 544 13 607 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther services 113 004 111 073 \\r\\n\\r\\nTOTAL 12 792 886 13 288 211 \\r\\n\\r\\nOPERATIONAL RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nOperational risk in Luminor is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or \\r\\nfrom external events. This definition includes legal risk, but excludes strategic and reputational risk. Operational risk management in \\r\\nLuminor is governed by the Operational Risk Policy. Key principles are that operational risk should be low/medium and Luminor’s \\r\\noperational risk management framework should ensure that the risk of unexpected losses is reduced. Each manager and process owner \\r\\nis responsible for the management of risks inherent to the activities and processes of their area of responsibility and for fostering a \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 68  \\r\\n\\r\\nsound risk management culture. The Operational Risk Management Department is an independent internal control function within the \\r\\nsecond line of defence and covers operational risk management, information security and personal data protection.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOperational risk management in the first quarter of 2020 was affected by the spread of COVID-19. At the end of February 2020 central \\r\\ncrisis management was initiated to assure business continuity and resilience and to protect Luminor employees. As main mitigation \\r\\nactions, remote working, social distancing and basic hygiene methods were used for employee protection. To ensure business \\r\\ncontinuity, business continuity plans were reviewed and updated, particular for critical services. Also critical vendor continuity readiness \\r\\nwas reviewed and assessed. Throughout the crisis so far, all of Luminor’s business processes and client services are operational without \\r\\nnegative impact for Luminor customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor management is kept updated on the status of operational risk through periodic and ad hoc risk reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s regulatory capital consists fully of Tier 1/Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Tier1/CET1 capital consists of ordinary shares, \\r\\nshare premium, mandatory reserve, retained earnings of the previous financial year, the audited profit of the current financial year and \\r\\nless the intangible assets, deferred tax assets, revaluation profit of investment properties, current year losses, if any, and other \\r\\ndeductions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital is calculated and allocated for risk coverage following the regulations in the CRD IV and CRR of the European Union and the \\r\\nlocal legal acts. The Group’s objectives in capital management are as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\n• consistency with Luminor Group’s long-term strategy (including meeting the risk appetite of the Group) and the Dividend policy; \\r\\n\\r\\n• the ability to pursue the business objectives; \\r\\n\\r\\n• fulfilment of both internal and external capitalisation targets (capital adequacy); \\r\\n\\r\\n• sufficient and proper composition of capital that would withstand stressful events. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital adequacy assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in accordance with the information guidelines for the risk \\r\\nmanagement and capital adequacy disclosure (Pillar 3) report. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 69  \\r\\n\\r\\nQuantitative information regarding the capital managed by the Group is presented below: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the prudential requirements, the Pillar 2 requirement set by the ECB in the 2019 Joint Decision on Capital and the Systemic \\r\\nrisk and Countercyclical risk buffer requirements set by the Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian regulators, Luminor Group is required to \\r\\nhold capital exceeding 10.8% CET1 and 15.2% Total capital.

The Group does not apply any VaR or other internal models for the calculation of the market risk capital \\r\\nrequirement and applies the Basic Indicators Approach for calculating the operational risk capital requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk-weighted assets are measured by means of risk weights classified according to the nature of each asset and counterparty, \\r\\ntaking into account the collaterals and guarantees eligible for risk mitigation. A similar treatment with some adjustments is adopted \\r\\nfor the off-balance sheet exposures. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group reviews and improves the risk identification and management policies and procedures according to changes in the Group’s \\r\\nactivities and financial situation at least once a year. Amendments and updates are mostly done during the annual internal capital \\r\\nadequacy assessment process when significant risks are to be reassessed or identified and assessed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group complied with all externally imposed capital requirements during the reporting period.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGOING CONCERN \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor’s management is fully convinced of a stable and balanced performance going forward and, based on that, prepared these \\r\\nfinancial statements on a going concern basis.  \\r\\n\\r\\n4.

The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of its \\r\\nfixed rate senior unsecured bonds. Trade date for 200 million EUR and 150 million EUR interest swap agreements is 10 October 2018, \\r\\neffective date is 18 October 2018 and maturity date is 18 October 2021. For 300 million EUR interest swap agreement trade date is 11 \\r\\nJune 2019, effective date is 21 June 2019 and maturity date 21 October 2022. For 500 million EUR interest swap agreement trade date \\r\\nis 04 March 2020, effective date is 11 March 2020 and maturity date 11 March 2025. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instruments as the terms of the interest rate swaps match \\r\\nthe terms of the fixed rate loan (i.e. notional amount, maturity, payment and reset dates). The Group has established a hedge ratio of \\r\\n1:1 for the hedging relationships, as the underlying risk of the interest rate swaps is identical to the hedged risk component. To test \\r\\nhedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging \\r\\ninstrument against the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHedge ineffectiveness can theoretically arise from:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• A different interest rate curve applied to discount the hedged item and hedging instrument;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Differences in the timing of cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument, also a different day count;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instrument and hedged item. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 74  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 1 150 000 5 972 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 650 000 1 898 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n*Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n11.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where the \\r\\nfair values of financial assets and liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active markets, they \\r\\nare determined in a way that unobservable inputs used to measure fair value would reflect the assumptions that market participants \\r\\nwould use when pricing assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risk. Where observable market data is not available, \\r\\nexpert judgment is required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements, the above mentioned techniques \\r\\nrelated to unobservable inputs were not used as no such financial assets and liabilities exist on the statement of financial position of \\r\\nthe Group. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 80  \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTISED COSTS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR  \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020 31 March 2020 31 December 2019 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortised cost         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central \\r\\nbanks \\r\\n\\r\\n2 755 941  2 755 941  2 924 019  2 924 019  \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 109 048  109 048  141 645  141 645  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 9 927 897  10 027 176  10 222 547  10 324 772  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 12 792 886  12 892 165  13 288 211  13 390 436  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities         \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortised \\r\\ncost \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n271 580  271 580  980 692  980 692  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 9 958 280  9 958 280  10 235 443  10 235 443  \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 1 156 054  1 154 774  651 716  653 967  \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 53 019  53 019  45 303  45 303  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 11 438 933  11 437 653  11 913 154  11 915 405  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarises the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities. Financial \\r\\ninstruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the \\r\\nmeasurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and shall be used without \\r\\nadjustment to measure fair value whenever available; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 2 — valuation techniques for which inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 are observable for the asset \\r\\nor liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be \\r\\nobservable for a substantial part of the term of the asset or liability; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 3 — valuation techniques for which inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to \\r\\nmeasure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there \\r\\nis little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective \\r\\nremains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset \\r\\nor owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs shall reflect the assumptions that market participants would use when \\r\\npricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk. \\r\\n\\r\\n

ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 83  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:  \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss (Pension Funds) - The value date method is used in the \\r\\nacquisition of pension fund units managed by Luminor Pensions Estonia AS and they are initially recognised at acquisition cost, which \\r\\nis the fair value paid for them. Pension fund units are revalued according to the effective net asset value on the balance sheet date.The \\r\\nfollowing methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Cash and cash balances with central banks – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at the same \\r\\nprice in an orderly transaction;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Due from other credit institutions – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at the same price \\r\\nin an orderly transaction. Due from other credit institutions are demand deposits;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Loans to customers – fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows with the base curve used by the \\r\\nBank (6m Euribor curve as average for all loans) as adjusted by credit riks factors. In 2018 Luminor had various different \\r\\napproaches to the fair value estimation (in the legacy organizations) and that Luminor has made an effort in 2019 to align the \\r\\nmethodologies across the different geographies. The current approach is in accordance with Fair Value procedure. Same \\r\\nvaluation technique is applied to all loan classes and accordingly all loan classes are classified under fair value level 3;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (debt securities) - for domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, \\r\\nthe quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading \\r\\noffers in the form of prices, yields or equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid \\r\\nprices shall be used taking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no \\r\\nquotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are clearly incorrect or \\r\\nartificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or similar; \\r\\n\\r\\n• The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the interest rates for \\r\\nitems with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured using the assumptions that market \\r\\nparticipants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (equities, debt securities):  \\r\\n\\r\\n• The quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source for local equities. These are securities for \\r\\nwhich active market exists based on the turnover, meaning availability of quotes at which market participants \\r\\ntransact in the local stock market. The quotes of foreign equities shall be taken from Bloomberg giving the priority \\r\\nto the primary market, and then to the country of issuer if the active market exists there. Otherwise, the market \\r\\nwith the highest liquidity (turnover) shall be used as a source for pricing. If the quotes in primary data sources are \\r\\nclearly incorrect or artificial, the price of particular equity shall be derived from liquid market data using sources \\r\\nlike Bloomberg or similar. Correctness of the quotes described above are the subject of expert judgment of the \\r\\nMarket and Liquidity Risk Management Department member together with the Bank’s Markets Department’s \\r\\ndealer responsible for equity trading. For equities of non-listed companies for which active market does not exist, \\r\\nany available trusted public information on recent trades shall be used for the pricing of the equity. Alternatively, \\r\\ndividend discount model shall be used to determine the price of equity. Expert opinion based on other available \\r\\nrelated market data shall be used for pricing of equity if the previously described methods are not possible;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• For domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the \\r\\npriority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading offers in the form of prices, yields or \\r\\nequivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid prices shall be used taking \\r\\nthe data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no quotes available \\r\\nfrom local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are clearly incorrect or artificial, \\r\\nthe prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or \\r\\nsimilar;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the interest rates for \\r\\nitems with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured using the assumptions that market \\r\\nparticipants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Derivative financial instruments – market data from financial data vendors, electronic trading platforms or third-party valuation \\r\\nare used for valuation purposes. The derivatives represent non-complex products valued with generally accepted models. \\r\\nValuation inputs are derived from the market data;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 84  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Loans and deposits from credit institutions – the fair value of loans equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the loans from credit \\r\\ninstitutions is under market conditions. Expected cash flows of the liabilities from the banks are discounted with the same \\r\\nmarket rates as loans. Loans from credit institutions are long-term. Deposits from credit institutions are demand deposits. The \\r\\nfair value of deposits equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the deposits from credit institutions is under market conditions;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Deposits from customers – the gross carrying amount of demand deposits as a fair value is applied as an approximation due to \\r\\nvery short maturities;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Debt securities issued – the debt securities issued by the Bank are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs and are \\r\\nsubsequently carried at amortized cost using effective interest rate (EIR) method. The fair value is calculated by discounting the \\r\\nfuture cash flows using the market interest rate yield curve. \\r\\n\\r\\n18.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as the Management Board. The Management \\r\\nBoard monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and \\r\\nperformance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit before tax and is measured consistently with profit before \\r\\ntax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of expenses after internal funds transfer pricing, as \\r\\nmanagement primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a performance measure. Fees and commission \\r\\nincome for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made between different product categories for segment \\r\\nreporting.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth Management. \\r\\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. Corporate Banking segment \\r\\nservices business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager and all leasing customers who do not have a bank relationship. \\r\\nRetail Banking segment services business customers without a dedicated relationship manager and private individuals not belonging to \\r\\nWealth Management segment. Wealth Management services wealthy private individuals and holding companies associated with those \\r\\nindividuals. Results of other operating segments are included in Other segment.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 86  \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments (including \\r\\ninternal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Other segment) and income and expenses not booked on \\r\\ncustomer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using internally agreed allocation mechanisms. Only assets and \\r\\nliabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating segments are reported under the respective segments, all other balance \\r\\nsheet items are reported under Other segment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first quarter of 2020 it was decided to transfer customers with leasing exposures but without a relationship to bank entities \\r\\nfrom Other segment to Corporate segment and restatement was made also to historic periods. From the first quarter of 2020 Luminor \\r\\nstarted applying Activity Based Costing to allocate personnel costs, administrative costs and depreciation between operating segments \\r\\nand restatement was also made to segment split of costs to 2019 figures. \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Corporate Retail \\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagment \\r\\nOther Total \\r\\n\\r\\nQ1 2020           \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group           \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 30 437 27 688 1 789 -5 834 54 080 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet fees & commission income 6 574 10 508 504 184 17 770 \\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income 3 059 1 285 94 3 363 7 801 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther income 773 407 0 -578 602 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal income 40 843 39 888 2 387 -2 865 80 253 \\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel costs, administrative costs and depreciation  -24 978 -41 726 -2 093 142 -68 653 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (losses/ reversal) on loans to customers -23 857 -3 727 -343 1 516 -26 411 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther 0 0 0 -4 154 -4 154 \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit before Tax -7 992 -5 565 -49 -5 359 -18 965 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Corporate Retail \\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagment \\r\\nOther Total \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020           \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Group           \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 4 700 796 5 330 415 82 017 -185 331 9 927 897 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal assets 4 700 796 5 330 415 82 017 -185 331 9 927 897 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 4 934 973 4 083 954 920 939 18 414 9 958 280 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal liabilities 4 934 973 4 083 954 920 939 18 414 9 958 280 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 87  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Corporate Retail \\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagment \\r\\nOther Total \\r\\n\\r\\nQ1 2019           \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group           \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 34 582 26 650 1 982 600 63 814 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet fees & commission income 6 945 10 648 532 589 18 714 \\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income 2 930 1 468 96 2 608 7 102 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther income 312 208 0 2 122 2 642 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal income 44 769 38 974 2 610 5 919 92 272 \\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel costs, administrative costs and depreciation  -26 541 -38 842 -2 406 133 -67 656 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (losses/ reversal) on loans to customers 1 130 6 430 39 -323 7 276 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther 0 0 0 -3 882 -3 882 \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit before Tax 19 358 6 562 243 1 847 28 010 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Corporate Retail \\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagment \\r\\nOther Total \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019           \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group           \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 4 925 549 5 401 323 82 047 -186 372 10 222 547 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal assets 4 925 549 5 401 323 82 047 -186 372 10 222 547 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 5 094 953 4 185 510 945 223 9 756 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal liabilities 5 094 953 4 185 510 945 223 9 756 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n20.

Constructive cooperation between governments, \\r\\nsupervisors, banks and customers made it possible to provide the early and necessary support to private individuals, as well as \\r\\ncompanies during those difficult times.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic governments have launched programs to mitigate the negative effects from the pandemic and to stimulate the economies. \\r\\nLuminor is utilising the state guarantees to the benefit of our customers. In addition to continuously providing financing, we are \\r\\nhelping to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic by offering simplified grace period solutions to all of our qualified customers. \\r\\nWe are supporting our customers further by extending the loan principal payment moratoriums until the end of September 2020 \\r\\nwhile retaining the existing conditions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the crisis, Luminor kept its customer service centres open while implementing strict measures to protect our customers \\r\\nand employees. To prevent the spread of virus, we were able to mobilise over 75% of our employees to working remotely in a very \\r\\nshort time. This experience has changed our ways of working and even coming out of the crisis, we have further adopted flexible \\r\\nworking time and place principles and encourage our employees to split their working days between office and remote work.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued the year with a strong financial standing, which is a solid platform to be there for our customers throughout the \\r\\ncrisis and to support them in coming out of it. Our funding structure was further improved with a continuous increase in deposits. By \\r\\nreaching loans to deposits ratio of 93%, Luminor has achieved fully independent funding structure and paid back the utilized part of \\r\\ncredit line from DNB and Nordea, while retaining the credit line as a stand-by facility. Net profit in the second quarter amounted to \\r\\n13.5 million EUR compared to negative result in the previous quarter, when larger loan loss provisions were recognised due to the \\r\\nspread of COVID-19.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the timelines being impacted by the pandemic, continuous progress was made with the carve-out across all three countries. \\r\\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, Luminor finalised the migration of customers in Lithuania to the common technology platform, \\r\\nbecoming fully independent of the systems of both DNB and Nordea. By the end of June, also more than 99% of Luminor’s customer \\r\\nbase in Latvia was using our common independent technology platforms, with the remaining customers being migrated in July.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the volume of deposits in the Retail Banking segment increased by 245 million EUR in the second quarter of 2020, the pandemic \\r\\nimpacted new sales across the product groups.  One of the top priorities for Retail Banking in the second quarter was to optimise its \\r\\nprocesses to improve the experience for customers and staff. The range of online services was expanded further by launching remote \\r\\ncustomer onboarding in Lithuania, after having successfully implemented it in Latvia. The service will be extended to Estonia in the \\r\\nthird quarter of 2020. Retail banking also continued with the transformation to strengthen its customer service process and advisory \\r\\nconcept. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe top priority for the Corporate Banking team in the second quarter of 2020 was to help corporate customers cope with the impact \\r\\nof COVID-19 on their businesses. Principal payment grace periods were granted for approximately 15.2% of the total corporate loan \\r\\nportfolio. Loan loss provisions totalled 12 million EUR, which was half less than in the first quarter. Loan volumes contracted by 5% in \\r\\nthe second quarter as demand for new loans dropped significantly in March and only started to slightly recover in June. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second quarter of 2020 saw continuous growth for the Wealth Management segment with the assets under management of \\r\\nPrivate Banking reaching 1.5 billion EUR and pension assets 1.4 billion EUR, a 9% increase for both from same quarter in 2019 and \\r\\n11% from the first quarter of 2020. The growth was supported by the high interest of existing and newly onboarded customers \\r\\ntowards the new Luminor investor platform. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor focuses continuously on being proactive and vigilant in preventing and detecting financial crime. During the second quarter \\r\\nof 2020, the financial crime risk management framework to prevent, detect, manage and report potential financial crime risk was \\r\\nfurther enhanced, supporting its conservative approach towards money laundering and financial crime. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is sure to be significant, the Baltic economies were strong when entering the \\r\\ncrisis, with a private and public sector debt in relation to GDP among the lowest in Europe. The Baltic states have also managed to \\r\\ncontain the virus outbreak relatively well. This may cushion the economic shock and promote a subsequent recovery from the \\r\\npandemic. All our joint efforts should now concentrate on restarting economies while keeping in mind safety considerations. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 4  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are grateful to our customers for turning to us for advice and support during those trying times and we assure them that we will \\r\\ncontinue to be here for them when coming out of the crisis.  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\n\\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 5  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral information \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor) was established on 1 October 2017 through the merger of the Baltic operations of DNB Bank ASA \\r\\n(Commercial Register no. 984 851 006, DNB) and Nordea Bank Abp (Commercial Register no. 2858394-9, Nordea) to create a new-\\r\\ngeneration financial service provider for local businesses and financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 it was announced that the transaction signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB, Nordea and US-based \\r\\nprivate equity firm Blackstone had been concluded and as a result a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone \\r\\nacquired a 60.1% majority stake in the bank. The bank’s initial owners Nordea and DNB each retained a 19.95% equity stake in \\r\\nLuminor, but an arrangement has been made by the consortium and Nordea for the purchase of Nordea’s remaining stake over the \\r\\ncoming years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with some 900 000 clients, 2 494 employees, and market share \\r\\nof 15.6% in deposits and 17.6% in lending as at the end of June 2020. Luminor has total shareholders’ equity of 1.6 billion EUR and it \\r\\nis capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 22.0%. Luminor’s core business is serving entrepreneurial people in the Baltics with a primary focus \\r\\non local companies and the financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers its customers a wide range of products and services through all possible channels, digital and physical, with 34 \\r\\ncustomer service centres in total in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, of which nine are meet-up points. Luminor owns 363 ATMs \\r\\nthroughout the Baltic states, and additionally provides services through 100 ATMs in partnership with other financial services \\r\\nproviders.  \\r\\n\\r\\n30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Estonia Latvia Lithuania GroupGr Total  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of customers ~130 000 ~222 000 ~558 000 ~910 000 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket shares      \\r\\n\\r\\nLending 12.6% 22.4% 19.4% 17.6% \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits 8.9% 15.7% 20.8% 15.6% \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of client service \\r\\ncentres, including meet- up \\r\\npoints \\r\\n\\r\\n8 10 16 34  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of employees 595 883 1 016 2 494 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe economic implications of the COVID-19 outbreak are certain to be significant as the pandemic has severely impacted growth \\r\\nacross all the regions of the world, including the euro area. The June 2020 World Economic Outlook of the International Monetary \\r\\nFund projects that global growth will contract by 4.9% in 2020, which will constitute the worst downturn since the Great Depression. \\r\\nGlobal output is expected to rebound by 5.4% in 2021. The uncertainty around this forecast is however greater than usual. Recent \\r\\ndata from economic surveys point towards economic stabilisation though, and to recovery taking hold in countries that have moved \\r\\nfurther towards taming the virus and lifting lockdown restrictions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe impact on the euro area, including the Baltic economies, is likely to be concentrated in the first half of 2020, and the recovery will \\r\\ntake hold from the third quarter of the year. The euro area is the key destination for Baltic exports, and it had already been hit quite \\r\\nevidently by the pandemic and the deteriorating economic environment in the first quarter of 2020. Particularly notable was that the \\r\\neuro area turned from soft annual growth of 1% over the year at the end of last year to a drop of 3.1% over the year and 3.6% over \\r\\nthe quarter in the first quarter, reflecting the substantial drag imposed by both consumption and investment on top of contracting \\r\\ntrade. The Baltic economies are famously open and were the fastest growing euro area economies in the past three years, but the \\r\\ntrend in their growth was gradually moderating well before the outbreak of COVID-19 as global trade became more muted. The \\r\\ndeceleration in growth in the first quarter was however more modest than the average in the euro-area as yearly growth held up at \\r\\n-0.8% in Estonia, -1.5% in Latvia and 2.4% in Lithuania. This can be attributed to labour markets being strong before the pandemic hit, \\r\\nwhich supported domestic demand.     \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 6  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic states have managed to contain the virus outbreak relatively well. External borders were swiftly closed and a quarantine \\r\\nperiod was introduced with proportional and partial lockdown measures as needed to limit the spread of the virus immediately after \\r\\nthe first COVID-19 positive domestic cases were confirmed in mid-March. The number of new virus cases each day was brought down \\r\\nto single digits as early as mid-May, with no second round outbreaks occurring after the economies reopened from the partial \\r\\nlockdown measures that were brought in to limit the spread of the virus. Each of the three Baltic states followed its own strategy and \\r\\nmedical plan to contain the spread of the virus as was the case in the other euro area countries. A common characteristic was that \\r\\nno full lock-down of the economies was deemed necessary as manufacturing industry largely continued to fulfil orders and several \\r\\nnon-food shops, such as building materials stores, remained open during the quarantine period in Estonia and Latvia. Furthermore, \\r\\nthe medical systems successfully maintained sufficient free capacity even as the spread of the virus was contained by the broad-based \\r\\ndistancing measures.    \\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth in the Baltic economies has been robust in recent years, as GDP growth has outpaced the euro area average by a significant \\r\\nmargin. Baltic private and public sector debt in relation to GDP meanwhile has stood in stark contrast to where it was going into the \\r\\nGlobal Financial Crisis as it has been among the lowest in Europe, and this may cushion the economic shock and promote a subsequent \\r\\nrecovery from the pandemic. Domestic demand and business activity held up well in the region until the pandemic started, as very \\r\\ntight labour markets supported wage growth in high single digits and strong consumer demand. This strong starting point explains \\r\\nthe relatively soft contraction in the Baltic economies in the first quarter, but it does not entirely insulate the region’s economies from \\r\\nthe impact of the pandemic.   \\r\\n\\r\\nSharp recessions in the Baltic economies, concentrated in the second quarter, are likely to be followed by a fairly swift recovery from \\r\\nthe third quarter onwards, assuming that there is no major re-emergence of the pandemic in Europe. A combination of factors will \\r\\nfacilitate this. Firstly, the key trading partners of the Baltic states, including Germany and the Nordic countries, have weathered the \\r\\npandemic quite well and have already taken substantial steps to reopen their economies, with economic data improving. Secondly, \\r\\nApril and May probably saw the lowest point in activity in the Baltics as retail sales started to rebound from May while economic \\r\\nconfidence recovered in both the two months after April once restrictions were lifted. Consumer demand has benefitted from fiscal \\r\\nsupport with unemployment keeping growing. Furthermore cross-border travel restrictions between the three Baltic states were \\r\\nlifted from mid-May, after which the EU Commission recommended that Schengen Associated States lift their internal border controls \\r\\nby 15 June. Tourism is, however, expected to recover only gradually in Europe.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall the recovery from COVID-19 has already started in the Baltic states following their re-opening. The European Central Bank \\r\\n(the ECB) has delivered substantial support to the euro area as a whole, and the Baltic states will benefit on top of this from targeted \\r\\nextraordinary fiscal support measures at both the national and EU levels to mitigate the consequences of the crisis. Targeted economic \\r\\npolicy continues to cushion household losses and provide support to firms to boost demand. There is no doubt that the loss of activity \\r\\nin the coming quarters will be significant, but it is crucial that the economies can recover swiftly as the spread of the virus remains \\r\\ncontained and the recovery in European economies gets underway with substantial economic policy support in the pipeline.   \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 7  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19 impact on Luminor \\r\\n\\r\\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the economies of the Baltic states is still being assessed, and some sectors and companies will not recover \\r\\nfor some years yet. It is natural in that case that, for direct or precautionary reasons, many customers will need to ask their banks for \\r\\ngrace periods for their financial obligations.    \\r\\n\\r\\nTo help our customers withstand the crisis, Luminor is offering simplified grace period solutions to both private individuals and \\r\\ncorporate customers in all three Baltic states. As at the end of the second quarter 2020, Luminor had granted grace periods to \\r\\ncorporate customers representing 15.2% of the corporate loan portfolio volume, and grace periods to private customers that covered \\r\\n8.0% of mortgage loans and 2.8% of other loans, mostly leases and consumer finance, across the Baltic states. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian governments have followed those in other countries around the world by launching \\r\\nprogrammes to stimulate their economies in order to mitigate the harm caused by the pandemic. Luminor is utilising the state \\r\\nguarantees to the benefit of our customers. Our main partners in this in the second quarter were Kredex in Estonia, Altum in Latvia, \\r\\nand Invega in Lithuania, and we expect that we will soon start working with the Estonian Rural Development Foundation and the \\r\\nLithuanian Agricultural Credit Guarantee Fund as well.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor kept its customer service centres open throughout the crisis but put strict measures in place to protect our staff and \\r\\ncustomers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent the spread of virus, over 75% of our employees were working remotely. After the crisis has ended, we are returning to \\r\\noffices, but also encourage our staff to split their working days between the office and remote work. \\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness development \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor completed its cross-border merger on 2 January 2019 and continues its operations in all the three Baltic countries through \\r\\nthe bank headquartered in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all assets, rights and \\r\\nliabilities of Luminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank \\r\\ncontinues its activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches. A new organisational set up and a new \\r\\ngovernance structure were also introduced, and new members of management bodies were appointed.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe deposits and financial instruments of the depositors and customers using the investment services of Luminor Bank AS and its \\r\\nLatvian branch and Lithuanian branch are guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and investor protection scheme established and \\r\\noperated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at the end of the second quarter of 2020, by reaching loans to deposits ratio of 93%, Luminor has achieved fully independent \\r\\nfunding structure and paid back the utilized part of credit line from DNB and Nordea, while retaining the credit line as a stand-by \\r\\nfacility. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe timelines for the technology programme were impacted by COVID-19, but continuous progress was made even so in the carve-\\r\\nout (separation from DNB and Nordea systems) across all three countries. During the second quarter of 2020, Luminor finalised the \\r\\nmigration of customers in Lithuania to the common technology platform we are targeting, and from the end of June we are operating \\r\\ntechnology platforms that are fully independent of the systems of either DNB or Nordea. Work to finalise the migration and \\r\\ndecommissioning of historical data is currently ongoing so that we can finally stop using the technology services provided by DNB and \\r\\nNordea under the Transitional Service Agreement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPhased customer migration made further progress in Latvia, and more than 99% of Luminor’s customer base was using our common \\r\\nindependent technology platforms by the end of June. The remaining customers were migrated in July, after which work will \\r\\ncommence on migrating and decommissioning historical data.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe testing of the new banking platform continued in Estonia, and it was launched  for pilot- users in July. Market launch and customer \\r\\nmigration are planned for the fourth quarter of 2020. The adverse impact of COVID-19 has delayed the launch, but we are still \\r\\nexpecting that the carve-out in Estonia will be completed in 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor further strengthened its Daily Banking offering in the second quarter of 2020 by continuing the launch and promotion of new \\r\\nservices and products that had got going in the first quarter. Following the success in Latvia, remote customer onboarding was \\r\\nlaunched in Lithuania in the second quarter. The service will be extended to Estonia in the third quarter.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 8  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe e-Commerce Gateway, which was launched for Mass Business customers at the end of the first quarter, received 310 applications \\r\\nand converted 159 of them into agreements. The e-Commerce Gateway provides card acquiring services that let businesses accept \\r\\nVISA and Mastercard cards, and it uses the Open Banking application programming interfaces (APIs) of major banks so that account-\\r\\nto-account payments can be acquired.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor also launched its Black Card in Lithuania. This credit card is an excellent value proposition for domestic and overseas use and \\r\\nthe aim is for it to become the target credit card for Luminor customers in all three countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe volume of deposits in the Retail Banking segment increased by 245 million EUR in the second quarter of 2020, which was a \\r\\nsignificant step up from the increase of 65 million EUR in the same period last year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19 meant that plans for marketing communications had to be adjusted and a number of campaigns and other activities aimed \\r\\nat gaining new customers had to be postponed. New sales of mortgages were down by 6.2 million EUR compared to previous quarter. \\r\\nInterest from customers in taking housing loans had returned by early May to where it was before the pandemic, but stricter scoring \\r\\ncriteria were held in place to limit potential risk exposure. The lending strategy was revised at the same time, and the gradual \\r\\nimplementation of it started to support the acquisition of target customers. A training programme on housing loans was created for \\r\\nfrontline staff and was launched in all three countries with six different training sessions and workshops. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the top priorities for Retail Banking in the second quarter was to optimise its processes to improve the experience for \\r\\ncustomers and staff. A number of processes were simplified and changes like the e-Commerce Gateway and remote onboarding were \\r\\nintroduced.  \\r\\n\\r\\nRetail Banking started the transformation process in the second quarter through which it will support Luminor’s strategic goal of \\r\\nbecoming a Digital Retail bank. This process includes a redesign of the customer service process and advisory concept, and an \\r\\noptimisation of channels and the organisational structure.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe top priority for the Corporate Banking team in the second quarter of 2020 was to support our corporate customers to cope with \\r\\nthe impact of COVID-19 on their businesses. Principal payment grace periods have been granted to corporate loans, representing \\r\\n15.2% of the total Baltic corporate loan portfolio volume.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoan volumes contracted by a further 5% in the second quarter as demand for new loans dropped significantly in March and only \\r\\nstarted to recover in June. More than 80% of the loan book continued to be amortised to its original schedule. Deposit volumes were \\r\\nunchanged and we continued to work to improve the granularity of our deposit base. Overall income increased slightly on the back \\r\\nof a rise in net interest income that came from both higher margins on lending and lower costs for funding. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second quarter of 2020 saw continuous growth for the Wealth Management segment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus on growing Private Banking meant that assets under management reached 1.5 billion EUR in the second quarter, which was \\r\\n9% more than in the same quarter of 2019 and 11% more than in the first quarter of 2020. The growth was supported by the high \\r\\ninterest of existing and newly onboarded customers towards the new Luminor investor platform, and high customer satisfaction with \\r\\nprovided Private Banking services.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPension assets increased to 1.4 billion EUR, which was 9% more than a year earlier and 11% more than in the previous quarter. By \\r\\nthe end of the second quarter Luminor had approximately 289 000 second pillar pension customers and 62 000 third pillar customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe safety and well-being of Luminor employees and customers remained our top priority in the second quarter of 2020 in all our \\r\\nactivities. Even as we continued to offer banking services to our customers and kept our branches open, we took comprehensive \\r\\nmeasures to assure the safety of our staff and customers. We used remote working as far as possible, with over 75% of our employees \\r\\nworking off-site, and we paid extra attention to cleaning and to the availability of disinfectants in our facilities and ATMs, while also \\r\\nproviding protective equipment to all our staff who needed it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also encouraged our customers to use digital services as much as possible, and we had more people advising customers at our \\r\\ncall centres and extended the working hours of those call centres. The remote onboarding service, which was already operating in \\r\\nLatvia, was also introduced in Lithuania in the second quarter. Online meetings, video meetings and a pre-booking system were \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 9  \\r\\n\\r\\nintroduced for Customer Service Centres to increase the share of remote services provided. All new payment cards or reissued \\r\\npayment cards were sent to customers by post, and the Baltic ratio for this was 95%.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo help our customers to mitigate the economic impact caused by the pandemic, Luminor is offering simplified grace period solutions \\r\\nfor both private individuals and corporate customers and is extending the lending moratoriums until the end of September while \\r\\nretaining the same conditions. \\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple webinars were held in each of the three countries that provided Luminor customers insightful and practical information \\r\\nabout working remotely, leading teams, developments in credit markets, and information security.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe community investment project Here for You was successfully completed in the second quarter as Luminor helped nine different \\r\\nbusinesses and NGOs in the Baltic states to build their e-Commerce Gateway capabilities and launch online shops. Tutorial web pages \\r\\nwere launched in Estonia and Latvia to educate customers further and to give them useful guidance about building online shops. \\r\\n\\r\\nTablets were provided to seven families in Lithuania through Save the Children programme in order to support home schooling and \\r\\nremote studying. \\r\\n\\r\\nEFFORTS TO PREVENT FINANCIAL CRIME  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor remains vigilant about financial crime and is committed to preventing and detecting it. We regularly review our anti-financial \\r\\ncrime (AFC) practices and invest in the human and technological resources that are needed. We constantly work to get a better \\r\\nunderstanding of our customers and their transactions, and to manage and report any potential financial crime risk. Luminor \\r\\npredominantly serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers who have a strong personal or business connection \\r\\nto the Baltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, Luminor further enhanced its financial crime risk management framework in order to prevent, \\r\\ndetect, manage and report potential financial crime risk even better, and this has been supported by its conservative approach \\r\\ntowards money laundering and financial crime. The framework covers the technology, policies and procedures employed to detect \\r\\nfinancial crime, assess risks, run training and awareness-raising, and monitor new and developing financial crime risks continuously.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is subject to a wide range of legal requirements, and so we are transparent in all our activities and we work closely with all \\r\\nthe supervisory and regulatory authorities. Luminor also follows the international guidelines, recommendations and standards issued \\r\\nby the regulatory and supervisory authorities, international bodies, local banking associations, and by the financial intelligence units \\r\\nin each Baltic state.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to invest in systems and processes so we can adapt in a constantly changing environment - an example is that full \\r\\ndomestic payment screening was introduced in the second quarter of 2020. The bank is further developing its common monitoring \\r\\nand screening solution in all three Baltic states and has envisaged several further developments that will be delivered during 2020 \\r\\nand the first half of 2021. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor considers that work to raise awareness is an important component of the financial crime risk management framework. In \\r\\nthe second quarter, 34 training events related to AFC and corporate compliance areas were held on 18 different topics. \\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER EVENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Estonian Financial Supervision and Resolution Authority (the FSA)in June 2020 published its ruling on the misdemeanour \\r\\nproceedings against Luminor Pension Estonia AS. The FSA stated that the information published in 2019 in the Key Investor \\r\\nInformation Documents by Luminor Pensions Estonia AS about the ongoing charges for managed pension funds was incomplete, and \\r\\nso it set a penalty of 170 000 EUR. Luminor Pensions Estonia AS had already published the corrected information to its customers in \\r\\nFebruary 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Shareholders Meeting of Luminor Bank AS in June 2020 appointed Maria Elena Cappello as a new member of the bank’s \\r\\nSupervisory Council. \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 30 JUNE \\r\\n\\r\\nJohan Pedersson Lilliehöök has resigned from the Supervisory Council of Luminor Bank AS as of 1 August 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 10  \\r\\n\\r\\n  Financial results \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit in the second quarter was 13.5 million EUR, which is 6.8 million EUR more than in the same quarter of last year. The loan-\\r\\nto-deposit ratio came down to 93.0% from 117.1% a year earlier. It was supported both by an increase of 1.0 billion EUR in deposits \\r\\nand a decrease of 1.4 billion EUR in lending portfolio.  \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income was 55.9 million EUR in the second quarter having been 67.0 million EUR in the same quarter last year, (please, \\r\\nrefer to additional information at Note 1) and this decline is explained by the planned effort to reprice and rightsize the balance sheet. \\r\\nNet commission income was 24% less than in the same quarter of last year, mainly because customer activity was lower as a \\r\\nconsequence of COVID-19. The lower level of customer activity was visible in the reduced number of transactions and volumes during \\r\\nthe lockdown period, but customer activity recovered at the end of the quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses in the second quarter were 64.8 million EUR, which is 3.9 million EUR less than a year earlier (please, refer \\r\\nto additional information at Note 1). Exceptional costs in the second quarter reached 23.5 million EUR, which is 18% more than the \\r\\ncomparable exceptional costs for the same period last year*. The largest part of the exceptional costs in the second quarter of this \\r\\nyear were IT expenses, which constituted 85% of them, while staff costs constituted another 11%. Total operating expenses excluding \\r\\nexceptional costs were 15% lower in the second quarter than in the same period last year. The underlying business performance \\r\\ncontinues to improve, which is reflected in improved cost-to-income ratio and return on equity excluding exceptional costs. Cost-to-\\r\\nincome ratio excluding exceptional costs decreased from 54.6% in the second quarter last year to 51.3% this year (6 month result was \\r\\n55.2% in 2019 and 51.1% in 2020) and return on equity excluding exceptional costs increased from 5.3% in the second quarter last \\r\\nyear to 9.2% this year (6 month result was 8.2% in 2019 and 5.7% in 2020, explained by loan loss provisions in the first quarter this \\r\\nyear as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic). \\r\\n\\r\\n*The comparable exceptional cost for the first quarter 2020 was 30.7 million EUR, and it was 19.8 million EUR in the first quarter 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nKey figures and ratios of Luminor**   \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\nQ2 Q1  Q2  January - June Full Year       \\r\\n\\r\\n2020 2020 2019 2020 2019 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit 13 463 -21 192 6 711 -7 729 33 078 53 997 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity 1 616 621 1 621 160 1 718 147 1 627 731 1 705 734 1 714 685 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE), % 3.3 -5.3 1.6 -1.0 3.9 3.1 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets \\r\\n13 357 895 \\r\\n\\r\\n13 492 \\r\\n719 14 081 334 13 603 840 14 662 559 14 522 261 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA), % 0.4 -0.6 0.2 -0.1 0.5 0.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 55 878 54 080 66 950 111 685 132 155 244 167 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets \\r\\n13 080 712 \\r\\n\\r\\n13 194 \\r\\n251 13 315 122 13 307 405 14 313 703 14 192 831 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM), % 1.7 1.6 2.0 1.7 1.9 1.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio (C/I), % 80.5 89.0 77.0 84.8 77.1 77.6 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio, %*** 0.13 1.05 0.38 0.60 0.06 0.22 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 9 616 727 9 927 897 10 979 181 9 616 727 10 979 181 10 222 547 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 10 344 572 9 958 280 9 374 812 10 344 572 9 374 812 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio, % 93.0 99.7 117.1 93.0 117.1 99.9 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET1 ratio, % 22.0 20.5 18.0 22.0 18.0 19.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio (gross), % 4.0 3.9 4.3 4.0 4.3 3.8 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income / Loans, % 2.3 2.2 2.4 2.3 2.4 2.4 \\r\\n\\r\\n** Quarterly ratios (ROE, ROA, NIM, C/I, Credit impairment ratio) are expressed on an annualised basis \\r\\n\\r\\n*** If loan recoveries prevail, the ratio is negative \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 11  \\r\\n\\r\\nExplanations  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity (belonging to the owners of the company) = (equity at the end of the reporting period + equity at the end of the previous period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) = Net profit / Average equity * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets = (assets at the end of the reporting period + assets at the end of the previous period) / 2  \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) = Net profit / Average assets * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets = (interest-earning assets at the end of the reporting period + interest-earning assets at the end of the previous period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) = Net interest income / Average interest earning assets * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio = Total operating expenses / Net total operating income * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio = Net losses or reversal on loans to customers / Net loans, average * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio = Loans to customers / Deposits from customers * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio = Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-weighted Assets \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL (non-performing loan) ratio = Gross impaired loans (Stage 3 loans) / Gross loans * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLENDING AND DEPOSITS  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lending portfolio continued to decrease and it was down to 9.6 billion EUR at the end of the second quarter from 11.0 billion EUR \\r\\na year earlier.

The composition changed slightly over the year as the share of deposits from the public sector increased from 17% \\r\\nto 21% and the share of deposits from business customers declined from 39% to 36% at the Baltic level. Luminor’s share of the deposit \\r\\nmarket in the Baltics decreased from 16.7% to 15.6% over the 12 months. \\r\\n\\r\\nASSET QUALITY FOR Q2 2020   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe adverse impact of COVID-19 had also affected asset quality at Luminor.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe severest impact was felt by industries like accommodation, tourism and aviation. Luminor’s exposure towards these economic \\r\\nsectors is relatively small, but the trends were also negative in the overall portfolio as other industries were hit quite severely as well. \\r\\nAs a result, requests for modifications including grace periods reached 1.1 billion EUR at the end of June 2020, covering 12% of the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 12  \\r\\n\\r\\ntotal credit portfolio. The flow of modification requests stabilised throughout May however, and was insignificant in June. The total \\r\\nvalue of modifications approved reached almost 1.0 billion EUR at the end of June 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 70% of the requests for modifications came from business customers. The reasons why business customers applied \\r\\nfor modifications earlier than individual customers did, might be that: \\r\\n\\r\\n• business customers were affected first; moreover, professional financial management leads business customers to \\r\\napproach their bank immediately, if they foresee a need for modifications;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• individual customers can often access unemployment benefits. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest part of the requests from business customers for modifications came from industries like real estate activities, \\r\\ntransportation and storage, wholesale and retail trade, and manufacturing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common modification requested was a grace period on principal payments. Luminor allows a full grace period covering both \\r\\nprincipal and interest payments in exceptional cases only.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe volume of overdue loans is fluctuating and not yet showing any clear negative trends, however, depending on the development \\r\\nof the pandemic and measures taken by governments, this might accelerate significantly during the second half of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s loan loss provisions reached 3.2 million EUR during the second quarter. Around two thirds of the loan loss provisions were \\r\\nfor Stage 3 exposures, while the rest were for Stage 1 and Stage 2. Stage 1 and Stage 2 loan loss provisions mainly increased because \\r\\nof changes in the macroeconomic outlook and downgrades. Stage 3 loan loss provisions were largely driven by forbearance measures \\r\\napplied to mortgage loans that triggered non-performing status. Loan loss provisions for the first quarter were 26.4 million EUR, \\r\\nbringing the total for the first half of 2020 to 29.6 million EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe share of non-performing loans, or the NPL ratio, was 4.0% at the end of the quarter, which is an increase of 0.1 percentage point \\r\\nfrom the previous quarter and was due to a decline in the total portfolio. The NPL ratio for the mortgage loan portfolio was 3.0%, \\r\\nwhich is an increase of 0.1 percentage point that was mainly due to the forbearance measures that were applied. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal allowance for expected credit losseson the balance sheet were 191.9 million EUR at the end of the quarter, of which 137.1 \\r\\nmillion EUR were for Stage 3 exposures. Non-performing loans totalled 393.8 million EUR at the end of second quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n

A key requirement for achieving this is \\r\\nthat the funding from former parents provided in equal parts by DNB and Nordea should gradually be replaced by other forms of \\r\\nfunding such as deposits and wholesale funding from third parties. As at the end of June 2020 Luminor was a fully self-funded banking \\r\\ngroup with zero outstanding funding from former parent banks under the debt facility agreement. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis has been achieved over time through reduced lending volumes and also through an improved funding structure. Deposits from \\r\\ncustomers stood at 10 344 million EUR at the end of the second quarter of 2020, and at 9 959 million EUR at the end of the first \\r\\nquarter. In March 2020 Luminor issued its inaugural five-year covered bond for 500 million EUR, which received a long-term rating of \\r\\nAa1 from Moody’s. The total nominal value of the bonds outstanding under the Euro Medium Term Note or EMTN programme was \\r\\n1 150 million EUR at the end of the second quarter of 2020 as Luminor had 650 million EUR of senior unsecured bonds outstanding. \\r\\nThe senior unsecured bonds issued under the EMTN programme have been assigned a rating of Baa2 by Moody’s. There were no new \\r\\nissuances during the second quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a committed funding facility agreement with its former parent banks that is provided in the form of a syndicate, with \\r\\neach partner in the syndicate providing 50% of the funding. At the end of the second quarter of 2020 the total facility stood at 2 337 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 17  \\r\\n\\r\\nmillion EUR and was fully unused, while at the end of the first quarter Luminor had used 150 million EUR of the credit line. The amount \\r\\nof the facility has been committed for five years from 1 October 2019, with an initial commitment for three years and the option for \\r\\nLuminor to extend it by up to two years, and it can be drawn with maturities of one, two or three years. The facility is partly secured, \\r\\nas Luminor had assigned mortgage loans to it with a carrying value of 1 667 million EUR at the end of the second quarter of 2020 and \\r\\nof 1 762 million EUR at the end of the first quarter. The total commitment was reduced by 700 million EUR in July 2020 to 1 637 million \\r\\nEUR following a voluntary cancellation by Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nStructure of Liabilities and Equity: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 April 2020 Luminor received its minimum own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) requirement in a decision of the Single \\r\\nResolution Board (the SRB) dated on 20 December 2019 that was executed for Luminor by a decision of  the Estonian Financial \\r\\nSupervision and Resolution Authority, dated on 1 April 2020. The MREL decision sets the following MREL requirements for Luminor: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Holding AS (the parent company of Luminor Bank AS) shall comply with the MREL at the consolidated level of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS of 17.28% of total liabilities and own funds at all times, and 11.97% of total liabilities and own funds shall be \\r\\nmet with subordinated instruments; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Holding AS shall have a transitional period until 30 June 2022 to comply with these requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at the end of the second quarter of 2020 the total MREL ratio stood at 16.6% at the consolidated level of Luminor Bank AS, down \\r\\nfrom 17% as at the end of the first quarter, while 11.8% of total liabilities and own funds were subordinated instruments as at the end \\r\\nof the second quarter of 2020 and 12.1% as at the end of the first quarter. It should be noted that the MREL requirements were set \\r\\nusing data as of 31 March 2019, which means the decision does not consider any subsequent events. \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, \\r\\nwith a stable outlook. There have been no changes to Luminor’s ratings since then. On 25 March 2020 Moody’s issued an updated \\r\\ncredit opinion for Luminor.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 March 2020 Moody’s assigned a definitive Aa1 rating to the mortgage covered bonds issued by Luminor Bank AS under the \\r\\nEstonian Covered Bonds Act. \\r\\n\\r\\n  LIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s structural liquidity risk is conservative and well-balanced, and it is based on metrics that measure liquidity risk and is \\r\\nappropriately adapted to the current economic and regulatory environment. Luminor uses a range of metrics to measure liquidity \\r\\nrisk, one of which is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The LCR for Luminor was 159% as at the end of the second quarter of 2020 \\r\\nand 144% as at the end of the first quarter under the definition of the LCR given in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). The \\r\\nratio increased as liquidity increased because lending volumes were lower. The liquidity buffer is composed of highly liquid central-\\r\\n\\r\\n345\\r\\n\\r\\n4 095 4 048\\r\\n\\r\\n2 201\\r\\n\\r\\n1157\\r\\n1623\\r\\n\\r\\nAll other Liabilities Corporate deposits Retail deposits Public sector\\r\\ndeposit s\\r\\n\\r\\nDebt  securities\\r\\nissued\\r\\n\\r\\nEquity\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 18  \\r\\n\\r\\nbank-eligible securities and cash. Long-term liquidity risk is measured as the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). Luminor’s NSFR rose to \\r\\n133% during the second quarter of 2020 from 126% at the end of the first quarter. It increased mainly because lending volumes were \\r\\nreduced and beneficial changes occurred in the structure of deposits that moved it towards more stable deposits. \\r\\n\\r\\n Q2  2020 Q1  2020 Q4  2019 Q3 2019 Q2  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 159.0% 143.7% 149.8% 144.3% 132.5% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR 133.2% 126.0% 123.0% 118.0% 127.4% \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are predominantly from residents of the Baltics.

Risk Exposure Amount (REA) has decreased to 7.2 billion EUR \\r\\nprimarily due to decrease of corporate exposures and the implementation of adjusted SME supporting factor. As at the end of the \\r\\nsecond quarter of 2020 Luminor had 1 587 million EUR in own funds and they were fully composed of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) \\r\\ncapital, meaning the Tier 1 and total capital ratios of Luminor stood at the same level as the CET1 ratio.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with the CRR, was 11.2% as at the end of the second quarter of 2020. The leverage ratio \\r\\nis calculated as total Tier 1 own funds divided by the total risk exposure measure, including the risk position on assets and off-balance-\\r\\nsheet liabilities. \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital ratios  \\r\\n\\r\\nPosition Q2  2020 Q1  2020 Q4  2019 Q3 2019 Q2  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeverage ratio 11.23% 11.46% 10.88% 10.89% 10.59% \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio 22.04% 20.54% 19.66% 18.73% 17.99% \\r\\n\\r\\nT1 capital ratio 22.04% 20.54% 19.66%   18.73% 17.99% \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal capital ratio 22.04% 20.54% 19.66% 18.73% 17.99% \\r\\n\\r\\n0.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.9%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.3% 1.3%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.3%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.4% 0.4%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.3%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.3%0.7%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.5%\\r\\n\\r\\nBaltic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOther EU Non-EU \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 19  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe prudential requirements, which are the Pillar 2 requirement set by the ECB in the 2019 Joint Decision on Capital, and the Systemic \\r\\nRisk Buffer and Countercyclical Risk Buffer requirements set by the Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian Supervisory Authorities, obliged \\r\\nLuminor to hold capital exceeding 10.1% of CET1 and 14.5% of Total Capital as at 30 June 2020.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE INFORMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) is a local credit institution whose parent company is Luminor Holding AS that is \\r\\nultimately controlled by BCP VII, an investment fund managed by an affiliate of Blackstone Group Inc. Other shareholders of Luminor \\r\\nHolding AS - Nordea Bank Abp and DNB BANK ASA - are considered to be the entities with significant influence over the Group. The \\r\\nLuminor Bank’s registered legal address is Liivalaia 45, 10145, Tallinn, Republic of Estonia. \\r\\n\\r\\nNew company Luminor Holding AS, established on the 14th of May 2019, is the new parent company of Luminor Bank AS since 23 \\r\\nSeptember 2019. Until 23 September 2019 the parent company was Luminor Group AB. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor Bank AS has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries through \\r\\nthe Estonian registered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone acquired a 60.1% majority stake in the Luminor \\r\\nHolding AS, the owner of Luminor Bank AS. Luminor Bank AS previous owners, Nordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB BANK ASA \\r\\n(\"DNB\"), each retained a 19.95% equity stake in the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current interim report, “Bank” (or Luminor Bank AS) refers to Luminor Bank AS. “Group” refers to the consolidated financial \\r\\nstatements of Luminor Bank AS and its subsidiaries.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 June 2020 Luminor Bank AS directly or indirectly owned majority in the following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\nRepublic of Estonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\nRepublic of Latvia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\nRepublic of Lithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Liising AS \\r\\n• Luminor Pensions Estonia AS\\r\\n• Promano Estonia OÜ\\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Asset Management IPAS\\r\\n• Luminor Finance SIA\\r\\n• Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS\\r\\n• Luminor Līzings SIA\\r\\n• Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA\\r\\n• Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n• Realm SIA\\r\\n• Salvus SIA\\r\\n• Salvus 2 SIA\\r\\n• Salvus 3 SIA\\r\\n• Salvus 4 SIA\\r\\n• Salvus 6 SIA \\r\\n• Trioleta SIA\\r\\n• Baltic ipasums SIA\\r\\n\\r\\n• Industrius UAB (under\\r\\nliquidation)\\r\\n\\r\\n• Intractus UAB\\r\\n• Promano Lit UAB (under\\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation)\\r\\n• Recurso UAB (under\\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation)\\r\\n• Luminor Investiciju \\r\\n\\r\\nValdymas UAB\\r\\n• Luminor Lizingas UAB\\r\\n• Gėlužės projektai UAB\\r\\n\\r\\n(under liquidation)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 June 2020 Luminor Bank AS had ownership in the following associated companies: \\r\\n• ALD Automotive AS (25%)\\r\\n• ALD Automotive SIA (25%)\\r\\n• ALD Automotive UAB (25%)\\r\\n• SIA Kredītinformācijas Birojs (22,61%) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n28 \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) was prepared in \\r\\naccordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed consolidated interim financial \\r\\ninformation does not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in \\r\\nconjunction with the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are consistent with \\r\\nthose followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, except \\r\\nfor the adoption of new standards effective as of 1 January 2020. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or \\r\\namendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. Several amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2020, but \\r\\ndo not have a material impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS Interpretation Committee agenda decision regarding deferred tax related to investments in subsidiaries \\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Estonia and Latvia have replaced the traditional profit-based tax regimes with distribution-based tax regimes where corporate \\r\\nincome tax is not payable on profit but rather on distribution of dividends. In accordance with IAS 12.52A and 57A, in distribution-based \\r\\ntax regimes no current or deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of undistributed profits until a liability to pay dividends is \\r\\nrecognised. As a market practice in Estonia, this accounting policy has been applied consistently to all undistributed profits in the group, \\r\\nregardless of whether those profits accumulated in the parent or in the subsidiaries. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2020, IFRS Interpretation Committee made an agenda decision where it concluded that the principle set out in IAS 12.52A and \\r\\n57A only applies to undistributed profits accumulated in the parent company and does not apply to undistributed profits accumulated \\r\\nin the subsidiaries. Instead, the principles described in IAS 12.39-40 should be followed in respect of undistributed profits in subsidiaries, \\r\\nstipulating that a deferred tax shall be recognized in respect of such accumulated profits, unless it is probable that they will not be \\r\\ndistributed to the parent in the foreseeable future. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is currently assessing the potential impact of the IFRS Interpretation Committee agenda decision on its financial statements \\r\\nand will reflect the impact, if any, in its 2020 annual financial statements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group presents financial information in interim report in the same format as it was presented in the annual financial statements \\r\\nof Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019, except for several changes in classification within the Consolidated \\r\\nstatement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as described below. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n29 \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in presentation \\r\\n\\r\\nContent of statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income has been reviewed for the Interm Report.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and applies assumptions that affect the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements and \\r\\nthe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s \\r\\nexperience and expectations of future events. In the first half of 2020, COVID-19 pandemic affected many economies, individuals and \\r\\ncompanies and thus also required Luminor to react and make certain judgements which inter alia had the effect on the impairment \\r\\namounts. \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognizes credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The Standard applies a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) \\r\\napproach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n30 \\r\\n\\r\\nfair value through profit or loss (FVPL), together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The assets to test for \\r\\nimpairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes assets where there has been \\r\\nno significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or which are classified as low credit risk (credit rating indicating investment \\r\\ngrade). The allowances for stage 1 assets are based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default in the next \\r\\ntwelve months (12-month expected credit loss). Stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk. The \\r\\nallowances for stage 2 assets are based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default over the life of the asset \\r\\n(lifetime expected credit losses). Stage 3 includes credit-impaired (defaulted) assets, and the allowances reflect the lifetime expected \\r\\ncredit losses. Material assets in stage 3 are tested for impairment on an individual basis, while for immaterial stage 3 assets a collective \\r\\nassessment is performed. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for an additional category - \\r\\npurchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) - regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable \\r\\ninputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include: \\r\\n\\r\\n• evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2; identification\\r\\nof unlikely to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3;\\r\\n\\r\\n• classification of forbearance and Watch list;\\r\\n• assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including the\\r\\n\\r\\nvarious formulas and the choice of inputs;\\r\\n• the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and \\r\\n\\r\\nexposure at default (EAD);\\r\\n• determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;\\r\\n• estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic and\\r\\n\\r\\npessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;\\r\\n• estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and assigning\\r\\n\\r\\nprobabilities to those scenarios;\\r\\n• setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe model applied (including triggers for significant increase in credit risk) was not changed in the first half of 2020. The macroeconomic \\r\\nparameters were reviewed to reflect the outlook due to COVID-19.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMore qualitative and quantitative information on an impairment of financial assets in light of COVID-19 is provided in Note 3 General \\r\\nRisk Management Policies. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from \\r\\nactive markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The input to \\r\\nthese models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in \\r\\nestablishing fair values. For the fair value of financial assets and liabilities refer to Note 17. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES\\r\\n\\r\\nThe information where no major changes have been implemented during first half of year 2020 is not disclosed in this interim financial \\r\\nstatements and can be found in the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements as at 31 December 2019. The interim financial \\r\\nstatements discloses information on changes directly initiated as part of the bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and aditional \\r\\ninformation about changes implemented during the reporting period not directly related to COVID-19 pandemic in further sections of \\r\\nthis note. \\r\\n\\r\\nMAIN GOALS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of risk management at Luminor is to achieve an optimal balance between the risk of losses and the earnings potential in a \\r\\nmedium- and long-term perspective.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s Risk Management function is organised in order to ensure efficient and effective risk management and full implementation \\r\\nof the principles and requirements outlined in Luminor’s Risk Policy and Strategy. The Risk Division is a structural unit of Luminor, which \\r\\nexecutes risk management function and reports to the Group Chief Risk Officer. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n31 \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the light of COVID-19 pandemic developments in Europe, the ECB-led Comprehensive Assessment (i.e. both the Asset Quality Review \\r\\nand Stress Test exercises) has been put on hold until further notice. Revised dates or timelines have not been disclosed yet. Luminor \\r\\ncontinues to focus on a COVID-19 impact assessment and has performed institution-wide stress tests under COVID-19 macroeconomic \\r\\nscenarios and financial shocks. These scenarios are updated on an ongoing basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the ongoing revision of tasks performed within the risk management function as well as to further facilitate the use of \\r\\nsynergies between departments, the Risk Division will be reorganized as of 1st of July 2020. The reorganization focuses on two main \\r\\ngoals. The first goal is to establish a clear split of responsibilities between the First and Second Line of Defense in regard to Market & \\r\\nLiquidity Risk Management. The second goal is to significantly enhance synergies in the Risk Division by merging most of data and \\r\\nmodelling related activities into one central department. The new organisational chart can be seen below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Enterprise Risk Department is a centralized centre of expertise and manages risk management tools and processes which run across \\r\\ndifferent risk types. The control function for operational risk lies under the responsibility of the Operational Risk Department. The \\r\\nMarket & Liquidity Risk Department is responsible for market risk and liquidity risk control. The First Line of Defence tasks previously \\r\\nperformed by the Market & Liquidity Risk Department were extracted into the Market & Treasury Middle Office, which is planned to \\r\\nbe moved out of the Risk Division to the First Line of Defence. The control function for credit risk is under the responsibility of the Credit \\r\\nRisk Department. The newly established Risk Data & Analytics Department combines now most of the activities related to data and \\r\\nmodelling. The Model Risk & Validation Department owns the model risk framework and respective validation activities. The Special \\r\\nProjects Department is newly set up to directly support the CRO on various ad-hoc projects and tasks. The Risk Division is part of the \\r\\nSecond Line of Defence and the organisational departments within the Risk Division report directly to the Group Chief Risk Officer \\r\\n(CRO).  \\r\\n\\r\\nCREDIT RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures imposed by most of the European countries had an adverse impact on the \\r\\neconomies in the first half of 2020. In particular the social- and economic constraints imposed by the governments across Europe and \\r\\nalso in the Baltic states implied a significant reduction of economic activity, including businesses being almost entirely shut down in \\r\\ncertain sectors, and increasing unemployment as a consequence. Since Luminor is one of the largest banks in the Baltic region, many \\r\\nof Luminor’s customers are directly or indirectly affected by this situation. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has been monitoring the spread of COVID-19 since early 2020 and has adjusted its risk management to the new operating \\r\\nenvironment. Luminor is further aware of its important role for the Baltic economies and communities and thus chose to be as \\r\\nconstructive as possible in its support towards customers early on and throughout the crisis. On the other hand, Luminor is also charged \\r\\nwith the responsibility to protect its depositors, and to make sure that Luminor’s balance sheet and the Baltic financial system do not \\r\\nbecome overburdened by companies for which there is no viable business model after the crisis. Unfortunately, some customers need \\r\\nto be significantly restructured due to the COVID-19 induced economic crisis, and in cases where even that is no longer feasible, some \\r\\nbusinesses might have to be wound down in an orderly manner. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania have joined the industry-wide private moratoria initiatives in each \\r\\ncountry, which comply with the European Banking Authority’s (the EBA) Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria on loan \\r\\nrepayments applied in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The moratoria are applicable for performing COVID-19 affected customers \\r\\nexperiencing temporarily financial difficulties, yet had acceptable payment discipline during 12 months leading up to the crisis. The \\r\\nterms of postponements are the following:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• for individual customers, a grace period on principal payments might be granted up to 12 months for mortgage loans and up to \\r\\n6 months for consumer credits and leasing agreements;\\r\\n\\r\\n• for business customers with an exposure below 5 million EUR, the period of payment postponement is up to 6 months for\\r\\namortising products.\\r\\n\\r\\nGroup Chief Risk Officer\\r\\n\\r\\nEnterprise Risk Operational Risk Market & Liquidity Risk Credit Risk\\r\\nRisk Data & \\r\\n\\r\\nAnalytics\\r\\n\\r\\nModel Risk & \\r\\nInternal \\r\\n\\r\\nValidation\\r\\nSpecial   Projects\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkets & \\r\\nTreasury Middle \\r\\n\\r\\nOffice\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n32 \\r\\n\\r\\nModification gains/losses were immaterial for 3 and 6 months 2020 period. In total Luminor prolonged 15% (volume) of corporate loan \\r\\nportfolio and leasing’s by 3-6 months, 8% mortgages by 6 months and 3% private other loans and leasing. \\r\\n\\r\\nAny other conditions shall not be changed, and the grace period can be granted only once. The moratoria remain in force until the \\r\\ndeadline set by the EBA; originally by 30 June 2020, currently extended until 30 September 2020. The modifications under the moratoria \\r\\nare not classified as forbearance if no other SICR indicators are present. For the cases not meeting moratoria conditions, an individual \\r\\nassessment is performed. \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment policies \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor recognises credit losses in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 applies a forward-looking expected credit loss \\r\\n(ECL) approach. For more detailed information on the impairment policies, please refer to the Note 5 General Risk Management Policies \\r\\nof the Luminor Bank AS Annual Report 2019. In the first half of 2020 the impairment methodology remained unchanged. \\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent authorities – the ECB, the EBA, the European Securities and Markets Authority (the ESMA), the IFRS Foundation, the Basel \\r\\nCommittee on Banking Supervision (the BCBS) – have announced various measures to deal with the crisis and minimise the effect on \\r\\nthe economies. Luminor acts in line with the above mentioned institutions’ guidance. The modifications granted for COVID-19 affected \\r\\ncustomers do not automatically indicate Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR), nor a classification to forbearance or default status. \\r\\nHowever, Luminor’s obligation to assess for unlikeliness to pay (which consequently triggers default status) remains in place. \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the ECB guidance, excessively procyclical forecasts of macroeconomic variables were avoided in the first half of 2020. \\r\\nLuminor’s macroeconomists updated the forecasts of macroeconomic variables used in the PD and LGD modelling at the end of the \\r\\nsecond quarter of 2020 with projections and assumptions over three years, assuming not only the nearest short-term downturn, but \\r\\nalso the recovery period in the market after that. Starting from the fourth year it is assumed that risk parameters (PD and LGD) converge \\r\\nto their long-term average levels (estimated over the cycle).  \\r\\n\\r\\n30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic \\r\\nvariables \\r\\n\\r\\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 (Baseline) Scenario 3 \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for \\r\\nscenario, % \\r\\n\\r\\n30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in \\r\\nreal GDP, % \\r\\n\\r\\n4.3 -6.7 5.7 5.4 3.4 -8.1 6.0 6.8 3.1 -11.7 2.9 6.4 4.2 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment \\r\\nrate, % \\r\\n\\r\\n4.4 7.7 7.5 5.5 5.1 10.2 9.1 6.5 5.7 10.8 12.8 9.8 8.5 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of \\r\\nresidential real \\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n\\r\\n7.0 -2.0 0.1 4.5 5.6 -2.0 0.1 4.5 5.6 -6.2 -6.5 3.5 4.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n33 \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvia \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic \\r\\nvariables \\r\\n\\r\\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 (Baseline) Scenario 3 \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for \\r\\nscenario, % \\r\\n\\r\\n30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in \\r\\nreal GDP, % \\r\\n\\r\\n2.2 -4.8 5.9 5.2 3.0 -7.5 6.3 5.4 3.3 -9.4 2.9 5.5 4.6 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment \\r\\nrate, % \\r\\n\\r\\n6.3 8.6 7.3 6.4 6.2 9.5 9.0 7.6 6.7 10.9 11.8 9.0 7.5 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of \\r\\nresidential real \\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n\\r\\n9.0 2.2 0.5 8.4 5.5 -0.4 -5.0 6.1 5.1 -2.2 -11.3 3.9 6.5 \\r\\n\\r\\nLithuania \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic \\r\\nvariables \\r\\n\\r\\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 (Baseline) Scenario 3 \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for \\r\\nscenario, % \\r\\n\\r\\n30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real \\r\\nGDP, % \\r\\n\\r\\n3.9 -5.1 8.3 4.8 3.5 -6.4 6.0 5.3 3.1 -9.5 3.2 4.9 2.6 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, \\r\\n% \\r\\n\\r\\n6.3 8.2 7.7 6.6 6.2 9.6 9.3 7.6 6.7 10.8 12.3 10.7 8.8 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of \\r\\nresidential real \\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n\\r\\n6.8 1.8 4.3 7.0 6.0 -1.5 -1.5 6.8 5.0 -4.8 -8.5 2.5 4.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n34 \\r\\n\\r\\nGross amount and expected credit loss allowance amount for loans and leases as at 30 June 2020 and 31 December 2019 are disclosed \\r\\nin the tables below: \\r\\n\\r\\n30 June 2020  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR  \\r\\nNote Gross \\r\\n\\r\\nAllowance for \\r\\nexpected credit \\r\\n\\r\\nlosses \\r\\nNet \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from banks and other credit institutions 9 99 216 -22 99 194 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial institutions 11 13 188 -185 13 003 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic sector  11 148 915 -32 148 883 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Business customers  11 4 093 412 -115 310 3 978 102 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans  2 950 778 -96 077 2 854 701 \\r\\n\\r\\nFactoring  184 086 -2 058 182 028 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing 958 548 -17 175 941 373 \\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual customers 11 5 553 118 -76 379 5 476 739 \\r\\n\\r\\nMortgage loans 4 636 952 -57 682 4 579 270 \\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer and card loans 121 883 -1 487 120 396 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther loans 309 748 -12 936 296 812 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing 484 535 -4 274 480 261 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 9 907 849 -191 928 9 715 921 \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\nNote Gross \\r\\n\\r\\nAllowance for \\r\\nexpected credit \\r\\n\\r\\nlosses \\r\\nNet \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from banks and other credit institutions 9 141 654 -9 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial institutions 11 29 378 -123 29 255 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic sector 11 174 732 -17 174 715 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Business customers  11 4 523 201 -111 037 4 412 164 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans  3 156 365 -95 544 3 060 821 \\r\\n\\r\\nFactoring  278 511 -1 691 276 820 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing 1 088 325 -13 802 1 074 523 \\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual customers 11 5 680 911 -74 498 5 606 413 \\r\\n\\r\\nMortgage loans 4 689 319 -56 080 4 633 239 \\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer and card loans 132 862 -1 452 131 410 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther loans 325 119 -11 938 313 181 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing 533 611 -5 028 528 583 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 10 549 876 -185 684 10 364 192 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe credit quality of loans to customers as at 30 June 2020 and 31 December 2019 are disclosed in the tables below according to the \\r\\ninternal risk scale for performing customers: probability of default for low risk rating grades (1 to 4) is in the range from 0.00% to 0.75%, \\r\\nfor moderate risk rating grades (5 to 7) it is from 0.75% to 3.00%, for high risk rating grades (from 8 to 10) it is from 3.00% to 40.00%.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe portfolio distribution as at 30 June 2020 shows an increase in Stage 2 (mostly due to inclusion of customers in Watch-list and \\r\\ndowngrades) and slight increase in Stage 3 (inflow of new non-performing exposures slightly outweighs the outflow) compared to the \\r\\nend of year 2019.

In case the external rating for a bank is not available a conservative expert \\r\\njudgment serves as basis for the Group internal rating, which reflects the bank’s credit strength, derived from macroeconomic factors \\r\\nand bank’s own solvency and liquidity factors, together with qualitative non-financial adjustments. The internal risk grade and \\r\\nprobability of default (PD) of banks is based on the available risk classifications from rating agencies Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and \\r\\nFitch.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Luminor a separate dedicated Financial Institutions unit acts as a single core competence center and ensures holistic overview of the \\r\\nGroup’s credit limits/exposure on banks and countries. Since March 2020, the Financial Institutions Department has switched from \\r\\nquarterly to daily portfolio monitoring. A Financial Institutions Credit Commitee is organised on a regular basis to follow-up the latest \\r\\nmarket developments and review if any changes/restrictions are needed for established credit limits towards banks and countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s portfolio consists of reputable investment grade correspondent banks that have not seen internal credit rating downgrades \\r\\nduring the second quarter of 2020, however some Nostro counterparts (3 banks) faced external rating downgrade by 1 notch from one \\r\\nof the three large rating agencies, mostly related to COVID-19 uncertainty or Parent downgrade (UniCredit Group). Yet, all the \\r\\ndowngraded banks are still at investment grade level. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n39 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities exposure  (Note 17: except for debt securities - Other financial corporations) of the Group at the end of the second \\r\\nquarter of 2020 was 246.7 million EUR compared to 214 million EUR at the end of 2019. Most of these debt securities are issued by the \\r\\ngovernments of Lithuania and Latvia. The other part consists of level 1 assets (using Liquidity Coverage Ratio terminology), including \\r\\nEstonian and Austrian sovereign bonds, and covered bonds issued by French companies. Lithuanian and Estonian corporate bonds \\r\\nwithin the trading debt portfolio forms the remaining very small part. The average weighted duration of the total portfolio is 4.2 years \\r\\ncompared to 3.1 years at the end of 2019. Debt securities investments are performed in accordance with the limits set by Luminor’s \\r\\nManagement Board and Supervisory Council. Limit utilization is monitored on a daily basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nEconomic sectors \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following tables break down Loans to customers at their carrying amounts as categorised by the economic sectors of our \\r\\ncounterparties.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and loans to central bank, credit institutions, and customers \\r\\n\\r\\nGroup \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n30 June 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash on Hand 124 241 140 518 \\r\\n\\r\\nCentral Banks 3 169 428 2 783 501 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 99 194 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Institutions 13 003 29 255 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic Sector 148 883 174 715 \\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual Customer 5 476 739 5 606 413 \\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness Customers 3 978 102 4 412 164 \\r\\n\\r\\nAgriculture, forestry and fishing 314 321 337 080 \\r\\n\\r\\nMining and quarrying 14 875 23 658 \\r\\n\\r\\nManufacturing 482 210 571 675 \\r\\n\\r\\nElectricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply 122 027 132 176 \\r\\n\\r\\nWater supply 28 998 31 948 \\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction 184 702 197 785 \\r\\n\\r\\nWholesale and retail trade 720 909 937 197 \\r\\n\\r\\nTransport and storage 338 980 394 660 \\r\\n\\r\\nAccommodation and food service activities 45 951 48 768 \\r\\n\\r\\nInformation and communication 22 648 26 558 \\r\\n\\r\\nReal estate activities 1 140 126 1 132 767 \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessional, scientific and technical activities 222 684 210 089 \\r\\n\\r\\nAdministrative and support service activities 186 937 209 227 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic administration and defence, compulsory social security 158 5 358 \\r\\n\\r\\nEducation 5 733 7 106 \\r\\n\\r\\nHuman health services and social work activities 21 854 21 432 \\r\\n\\r\\nArts, entertainment and recreation 12 824 13 607 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther services 112 165 111 073 \\r\\n\\r\\nTOTAL 13 009 590 13 288 211 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n40 \\r\\n\\r\\nMARKET RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has a low risk appetite for market risk, which is defined as the risk of losses in on- and off-balance sheet positions arising \\r\\nfrom adverse movements in market parameters such as interest rates, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, equity prices or \\r\\ncommodity prices. Based on internal risk self-assessment, the most significant parts of the market risk for the Group are interest rate \\r\\nrisk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange risk, which all stayed well within internal Risk Appetite Framework and lower level limits, \\r\\nwhile the exposures where at the similar levels as they were in the last reporting quarter. The significance of other risks is lower, as the \\r\\nGroup does not have any open positions in equity instruments for trading, while all commodity deals with customers are hedged in the \\r\\nmarket with back-to-back transactions. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the major negative impact to the Group in terms of market risk could arise from \\r\\ncredit spread risk. This risk is mitigated by limits as well as certain quality requirements for the bond portfolios. The Bank follows a \\r\\nrigorous framework for debt securities management. Bond portfolios managed by Treasury and Asset and Liability Management and \\r\\nMarkets Departments are restricted in size, level of quality, region available and counterparty, limiting credit risk exposure. However, \\r\\nthe bank measures the stressed spread impact to its liquidity bond portfolio as part of the Risk Appetite Framework. Assuming a 100 \\r\\nbasis points spread widening towards risk-free alternative investments of matching maturity profile for A-rated bonds and a 50 basis \\r\\npoints spread widening for corresponding AA-rated bonds, the projected decrease in market value of the bonds would be the following: \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR 30 June 2020 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket value loss projection due to increase in credit spreads 7 850 6 523 \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations in time, the risk of incurring losses due to \\r\\nsudden decrease in financial resources (e.g. a financial crisis situation may result in a delay of incoming payments) or an increase of the \\r\\nprice of new resources for refinancing. The consequence of liquidity risk may be failure to meet obligations to repay depositors and \\r\\nfulfil loan commitments. The Group uses a range of liquidity metrics for measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk including \\r\\nthe Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), internal liquidity limits and trigger events, survival horizon \\r\\nmetric as part of liquidity stress testing. \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed to ensure a constant ability to settle contractual obligations. The Group has developed a set of early warning \\r\\nindicators for a timely identification of liquidity crises, and business and funding contingency plans to manage the Group’s liquidity \\r\\nduring market disruptions. The liquidity risk management strategy is reviewed at least annually or after any significant change in the \\r\\ninternal or external environment the Group operates in.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed across the three Lines of Defence: \\r\\n\\r\\n• The First Line of Defence comprises the Group’s Treasury and Asset and Liability Management (TALM) and the business areas.\\r\\nTALM is responsible for the daily liquidity management and funds transfer pricing (FTP). To ensure the funding in situations where\\r\\nLuminor is in urgent need of cash and the normal funding sources do not suffice, Luminor holds a liquidity buffer that consists of\\r\\ncentral bank cash and high quality securities that can be readily sold or used as collateral for funding operations;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Market and Liquidity Risk Department is the Second Line of Defence and is responsible for providing independent oversight and\\r\\ncontrol of liquidity risk and the First Line of Defence;\\r\\n\\r\\n• The Internal Audit function is the Third Line of Defence, which is responsible for providing independent assurance over the First\\r\\nand Second Lines of Defence activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk management has a focus on short term obligations and more structural long-term liquidity risk. Both short term and long-\\r\\nterm liquidity risks are measured and limited with different internal and external metrics.  The main metrics used to monitor liquidity \\r\\nrisk are LCR, NSFR and Surivival Horizon. The aim of intraday and short-term liquidity management is to meet the daily need for funds \\r\\nto ensure compliance with the reserve and liquidity requirements set by the ECB, as well as compliance with internal liquidity limits. \\r\\nShort-term liquidity is maintained through the daily monitoring of the liquidity status, day-to-day funding and trading the appropriate \\r\\nfinancial instruments for liquidity purposes. Long-term liquidity risk management is supported by analysing the estimated future cash \\r\\nflows considering deposit and loan portfolio growth, as well as possible refinancing sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of liquidity risk assessment, the liquidity gap is analysed considering the maturity of cash flows. The liquidity risk is \\r\\nrestricted by imposing internal limits on the liquidity gap. Utilisation of this limit is subject to regular monitoring and reporting to \\r\\nmanagement bodies in the Group. The liquidity gap is calculated by analysing the Group’s net refinancing situation within one week, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n41 \\r\\n\\r\\none month and three months applying a \"business as usual\" approach. Liquid assets and short-term liabilities are included in liquidity \\r\\ngap calculations for respective terms (1 week to 3 months). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe LCR is calculated as the ratio of a credit institution’s liquidity buffer to its net liquidity outflows over a 30-calendar-day stress period \\r\\nand is expressed as a percentage. The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of the Group’s liquidity risk profile and \\r\\nrequires the holding of risk-free assets that may be easily liquidated to meet required payments for outflows net of inflows during a \\r\\nthirty-day crisis period without support from the central bank. The minimum regulatory limit of LCR is set at 100%, however the Group \\r\\nhas a substantial buffer over it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is defined as the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable \\r\\nfunding over a one-year time horizon. The minimum requirement for NSFR is 100%, however the Group has a substantial buffer and \\r\\nmaintains a higher ratio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has set the limits in place for various measures, including LCR, NSFR, liquidity gaps, and manages those within the set limits \\r\\nby ensuring the proper maturity structure of its assets and liabilities, for example, via issuing long dated debt.

buffer and collateral management \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a contractual agreement for funding in place with shareholders DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank Abp. This strongly \\r\\nmitigates the likelihood of funding liquidity risk which may be caused by deposit run off, wholesale funding risk (roll over and new \\r\\nissuance), unexpected outflows from off-balance sheet obligations and legal risks (e.g. not being able to issue funding due to legal \\r\\nrestrictions). As the Group is moving towards more reliance on self-funding rather than on support from shareholders, other funding \\r\\nsources are being established or are already in place for diversifying the funding base. Luminor also relies on the stability of current \\r\\ncustomer deposits. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group is taking part in the ECB’s Eurosystem open market operations. In particular, the Group is a user of the ECB Targeted Long \\r\\nTerm Refinancing Operations (TLTRO). In addition, a significant part of funding is attracted through retail and corporate deposits. \\r\\nMoreover, the Group has already issued 650 million EUR of its own senior debt securities and 500 million EUR of covered bonds, and is \\r\\nconsidering to increase this amount in the future even more, which would further diversify the funding opportunities. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main part of the liquidity buffer is held with the Central Bank Accounts where the Group held 3.1 billion EUR at the end of June \\r\\n2020. This buffer can be utilized at any time when the need arises. \\r\\n\\r\\nSurvival horizon \\r\\n\\r\\nThe key metric for liquidity risk appetite set in the Risk Appetite Framework is the survival horizon analysed across different stress \\r\\nscenarios. The survival horizon is defined as a period with a positive cumulative cash flow. It is used to capture the liquidity buffer \\r\\navailable outright to be used in liquidity stress situations within 12 months. The outcome of liquidity stress testing is the number of \\r\\ndays the Group can withstand a liquidity crisis considering Luminor’s mitigating capacity, for example the liquidity buffer. \\r\\n\\r\\nThree different scenarios are considered while measuring survival horizon: bank-specific, market-wide and the combination of the most \\r\\nsevere assumptions from the previous two. Stress testing assumptions include but are not limited to severe deposit withdrawals, \\r\\nincluding early termination of term deposits and run-off of top 5 depositors, deterioration of financial assets, decrease of loan \\r\\nrepayment levels, increase of utilization of credit commitments, as well as limited availability of credit lines from shareholders based \\r\\non the existing Facility Agreement. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n46 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity buffer for the survival horizon metric is strongly affected by the assumption of outgoing deposits in the first few days and \\r\\nweeks of the turbulence period, with the smaller continuous run-off occurring in the following months. Due to rather high concentration \\r\\nof top depositors, the Group tests resistance towards a run-off of the 5 largest depositors as well. Total funds of the top 5 largest \\r\\ndepositors amounted to 1 287 million EUR at the end of the second quarter of 2020 compared to 1347 million EUR at the end of 2019. \\r\\nDespite that the Group has sufficient liquidity and can survive for longer than 1 year period without any additional support. On top of \\r\\nthat, Luminor has substantial unused credit line from shareholders which can be utilized at any time based on the mutual Facility \\r\\nAgreement. Furthermore, the majority of liquid buffer consists of cash held within central banks and highly liquid debt securities which \\r\\nsubstantially softens the consequences of deteriorating liquidity in case of high outflows.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s liquidity situation is sufficiently strong to survive severe external shocks. \\r\\n\\r\\nOPERATIONAL RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or external events. \\r\\nOperational risk in Luminor includes the following sub-risks: Legal risk, Compliance risk, Fraud and Financial Crime risk, Conduct risk, \\r\\nICT risk, Information Security risk, Data Management and Protection risk, People risk, Third Party/Outsourcing risk, Change/Project risk, \\r\\nProcess & Reporting risk and excludes Reputational risk and Business Model risk.    \\r\\n\\r\\nOperational risk management in Luminor is governed by the Operational Risk Policy and Subsidiary Governance Framework \\r\\ndocumentation. Each manager and process owner within the bank is responsible for the management of risks inherent in the activities \\r\\nand processes within their respective area. This includes fostering a sound risk culture in their respective reporting lines to ensure that \\r\\nemployees understand the operations that are performed by them, the risks inherent in these, and the importance of controls they \\r\\nexecute or oversee the execution of.   \\r\\n\\r\\nA key objective of the Operational Risk Department is to identify any deviations of Luminor’s operational risk profile from the desired \\r\\nrisk level that is stated in the Risk Appetite Framework, and to do so in a timely manner to ensure any deviations can be effectively \\r\\nmanaged without significant detriment to the bank, its customers or other stakeholders. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second quarter of 2020 saw a stabilisation in operational risk management across Luminor following the outbreak of COVID-19 in \\r\\nthe first quarter of 2020. The crisis management committee stood down in May, and staff incrementally began to return to work in \\r\\nLuminor’s offices throughout the quarter, in accordance with relevant social distancing rules and precautions. None of Luminor’s \\r\\nbusiness processes or client services were significantly interrupted as a result of COVID-19, and the Bank’s management of the situation \\r\\nevidenced Luminor’s ability to operate under it’s business continuity plans during crisis conditions. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor management is kept updated on the status of operational risk through periodic and ad hoc risk reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s regulatory capital consists fully of Tier 1/Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Tier1/CET1 capital consists of ordinary shares, \\r\\nshare premium, mandatory reserve, retained earnings of the previous financial year, the audited profit of the current financial year and \\r\\nless the intangible assets, deferred tax assets, revaluation profit of investment properties, current year losses, if any, and other \\r\\ndeductions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital is calculated and allocated for risk coverage following the regulations in the CRD IV and CRR of the European Union and the \\r\\nlocal legal acts. The Group’s objectives in capital management are as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\n• consistency with Luminor Group’s long-term strategy (including meeting the risk appetite of the Group) and the Dividend policy;\\r\\n• the ability to pursue the business objectives;\\r\\n• fulfilment of both internal and external capitalisation targets (capital adequacy);\\r\\n• sufficient and proper composition of capital that would withstand stressful events.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital adequacy assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in accordance with the information guidelines for the risk \\r\\nmanagement and capital adequacy disclosure (Pillar 3) report. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n47 \\r\\n\\r\\nQuantitative information regarding the capital managed by the Group is presented below: \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the prudential requirements, the Pillar 2 requirement set by the ECB in the 2019 Joint Decision on Capital and the Systemic \\r\\nrisk and Countercyclical risk buffer requirements set by the Central Banks of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, Luminor Group is required \\r\\nto hold capital exceeding 10.1% CET1 and 14.5% Total capital. Total capital and CET1 capital requirements consist of the following \\r\\ncomponents: \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal capital CET1 \\r\\n\\r\\nMinimum Pillar 1 requirement 8.0 % 4.5 % \\r\\n\\r\\nPillar 2 requirement 2.0 % 1.1 % \\r\\n\\r\\nO-SII (other systemically important institution) buffer 2.0 % 2.0 % \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital conservation buffer 2.5 % 2.5 % \\r\\n\\r\\nSystemic risk buffer* 0.0 % 0.0 % \\r\\n\\r\\nCountercyclical buffer* 0.0 % 0.0 % \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal regulatory requirement 14.5 % 10.1 % \\r\\n\\r\\n* As response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the systemic risk buffer was set to 0% starting from 1 May 2020 and the countercyclical buffer was set to 0% \\r\\nstarting from 1 April 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Regulatory Requirements for Calculating the Minimum Capital Requirements, the Group shall provide own funds, which \\r\\nmust at all times exceed or equal the sum of the capital requirements for: \\r\\n\\r\\n• credit risk;\\r\\n• market risk;\\r\\n• operational risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn compliance with these regulations, the Group calculates the credit risk and market risk minimum capital requirements by using the \\r\\nStandardised approach. The Group does not apply any Value at Risk (VaR) or other internal models for the calculation of the market \\r\\nrisk capital requirement and applies the Basic Indicators Approach for calculating the operational risk capital requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\n thousand EUR 30 June 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nOWN FUNDS \\r\\n\\r\\n1.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where the \\r\\nfair values of financial assets and liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active markets, they \\r\\nare determined in a way that unobservable inputs used to measure fair value would reflect the assumptions that market participants \\r\\nwould use when pricing assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risk. Where observable market data is not available, \\r\\nexpert judgment is required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements, the above mentioned techniques \\r\\nrelated to unobservable inputs were not used as no such financial assets and liabilities exist on the statement of financial position of \\r\\nthe Group.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTISED COSTS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR  \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value \\r\\n\\r\\n30 June 2020 30 June 2020 31 December 2019 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortised cost \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 3 293 669  3 293 669  2 924 019  2 924 019  \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 99 194  99 194  141 645  141 645  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 9 616 727  9 198 746  10 222 547  10 324 772  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 13 009 590  12 591 609  13 288 211  13 390 436  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 103 124  103 124  980 692  980 692  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 10 344 572  10 344 572  10 235 443  10 235 443  \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 1 157 038  1 155 652  651 716  653 967  \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 61 597  61 597  45 303  45 303  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 11 666 331  11 664 945  11 913 154  11 915 405  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n56 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarises the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities. Financial \\r\\ninstruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the\\r\\nmeasurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and shall be used without\\r\\nadjustment to measure fair value whenever available;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 2 — valuation techniques for which inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 are observable for the asset\\r\\nor liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be\\r\\nobservable for a substantial part of the term of the asset or liability; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 3 — valuation techniques for which inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to\\r\\nmeasure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there \\r\\nis little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective \\r\\nremains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset\\r\\nor owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs shall reflect the assumptions that market participants would use when\\r\\npricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n57 \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 30 June 2020 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 3 293 669 0 0 3 293 669 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 99 139 55 0 99 194 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 9 198 746 9 198 746 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial assets 0 0 12 170 12 170 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 9 489 0 0 9 489 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 3 839 0 3 839 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Goverments 213 239 0 0 213 239 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 23 965 0 0 23 965 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial corporations 0 0 14 707 14 707 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 46 349 768 47 117 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 140 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  3 639 501  50 243  9 226 531  12 916 275  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are disclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 72 825 30 299 0 103 124 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 8 436 938 1 907 634 10 344 572 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 497 279 658 373 0 1 155 652 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 61 597 61 597 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 42 193 1 514 43 707 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  570 104  9 167 803  1 970 744  11 708 652  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n58 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 31 December 2019 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 2 924 019 0 0 2 924 019 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 141 596 49 0 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 10 324 772 10 324 772 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial assets 0  0 29 113 29 113 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 3 021 0 0 3 021 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 4 033 0 4 033 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Goverments 195 989 0 0 195 989 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 15 023 0 0 15 023 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial corporations 0 0 12 851 12 851 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 58 087 1 130 59 217 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 140 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  3 279 648  62 169  10 368 006  13 709 823  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are disclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 29 080 951 612 0 980 692 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 8 074 410 2 161 033 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 653 967 0 653 967 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 45 303 45 303 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 56 042 2 262 58 304 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  29 080  9 736 031  2 208 598  11 973 709  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss (Pension Funds) - The value date method is used in the \\r\\nacquisition of pension fund units managed by Luminor Pensions Estonia AS and they are initially recognised at acquisition cost, which \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n59 \\r\\n\\r\\nis the fair value paid for them. Pension fund units are revalued according to the effective net asset value on the balance sheet date.The \\r\\nfollowing methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Cash and cash balances with central banks – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at the same \\r\\nprice in an orderly transaction;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Due from other credit institutions – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at the same price\\r\\nin an orderly transaction. Due from other credit institutions are demand deposits;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Loans to customers – fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows with the loan portfolio\\r\\naverage rate which was calculated based on the Bank  new sales margin of Q1 2020 and total volume of the loan portfolio\\r\\nthat included  credit risk factors. Same valuation technique is applied to all loan classes and accordingly all loan classes are\\r\\nclassified under fair value level 3. As at 31 December 2019 fair value was estimated by discounting estimated future cash\\r\\nflows with the base curve used by the Bank (6m Euribor curve as average for all loans) as adjusted by credit riks factors; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (debt securities) - for domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states,\\r\\nthe quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading\\r\\noffers in the form of prices, yields or equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid\\r\\nprices shall be used taking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no\\r\\nquotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are clearly incorrect or\\r\\nartificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or similar;\\r\\n\\r\\n• The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the interest rates for\\r\\nitems with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured using the assumptions that market\\r\\nparticipants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (equities, debt securities):\\r\\n\\r\\n• The quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source for local equities. These are securities for\\r\\nwhich active market exists based on the turnover, meaning availability of quotes at which market participants\\r\\ntransact in the local stock market. The quotes of foreign equities shall be taken from Bloomberg giving the priority\\r\\nto the primary market, and then to the country of issuer if the active market exists there. Otherwise, the market\\r\\nwith the highest liquidity (turnover) shall be used as a source for pricing. If the quotes in primary data sources are\\r\\nclearly incorrect or artificial, the price of particular equity shall be derived from liquid market data using sources\\r\\nlike Bloomberg or similar. Correctness of the quotes described above are the subject of expert judgment of the\\r\\nMarket and Liquidity Risk Management Department member together with the Bank’s Markets Department’s\\r\\ndealer responsible for equity trading. For equities of non-listed companies for which active market does not exist,\\r\\nany available trusted public information on recent trades shall be used for the pricing of the equity. Alternatively,\\r\\ndividend discount model shall be used to determine the price of equity. Expert opinion based on other available\\r\\nrelated market data shall be used for pricing of equity if the previously described methods are not possible;\\r\\n\\r\\n• For domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the\\r\\npriority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading offers in the form of prices, yields or\\r\\nequivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid prices shall be used taking\\r\\nthe data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no quotes available \\r\\nfrom local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are clearly incorrect or artificial, \\r\\nthe prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or\\r\\nsimilar;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Derivative financial instruments – market data from financial data vendors, electronic trading platforms or third-party valuation\\r\\nare used for valuation purposes. The derivatives represent non-complex products valued with generally accepted models.\\r\\nValuation inputs are derived from the market data;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Loans and deposits from credit institutions – the fair value of loans equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the loans from credit \\r\\ninstitutions is under market conditions. Expected cash flows of the liabilities from the banks are discounted with the same \\r\\nmarket rates as loans. Loans from credit institutions are long-term. Deposits from credit institutions are demand deposits. The\\r\\nfair value of deposits equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the deposits from credit institutions is under market conditions;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Deposits from customers – the gross carrying amount of demand deposits as a fair value is applied as an approximation due to\\r\\nvery short maturities;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n60 \\r\\n\\r\\n• Debt securities issued – the debt securities issued by the Bank are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs and are \\r\\nsubsequently carried at amortized cost using effective interest rate (EIR) method. The fair value is calculated by discounting the \\r\\nfuture cash flows using the market interest rate yield curve. Covered bonds are classified as Level 1 as they are actively traded\\r\\non market using the market rate yield curve (swaps curve) provided by Bloomberg.\\r\\n\\r\\n18.

SEGMENT REPORTING\\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as the Management Board. The Management \\r\\nBoard monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and \\r\\nperformance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit before tax and is measured consistently with profit before \\r\\ntax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of expenses after internal funds transfer pricing, as \\r\\nmanagement primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a performance measure. Fees and commission \\r\\nincome for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made between different product categories for segment \\r\\nreporting.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth Management. \\r\\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. Corporate Banking segment \\r\\nservices business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager and all leasing customers who do not have a bank relationship. \\r\\nRetail Banking segment services business customers without a dedicated relationship manager and private individuals not belonging to \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n62 \\r\\n\\r\\nWealth Management segment. Wealth Management services wealthy private individuals and holding companies associated with those \\r\\nindividuals. Results of other operating segments are included in Other segment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments (including \\r\\ninternal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Other segment) and income and expenses not booked on \\r\\ncustomer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using internally agreed allocation mechanisms. Only assets and \\r\\nliabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating segments are reported under the respective segments, all other balance \\r\\nsheet items are not reported under the operating segments to CODM. Loans and Deposits are reported under operating segments at \\r\\nGross amounts (and excluding accrued interest). Net impairment (losses/reversal) on loans to customers is monitored for each of the \\r\\nsegments at Profit or Loss side, while at the Assets side, the CODM only monitors Gross amounts of Loans to customers, with \\r\\nimpairment allowances not being allocated to operating segments. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first quarter of 2020 it was decided to transfer customers with leasing exposures but without a relationship to bank entities \\r\\nfrom Other segment to Corporate segment and restatement was made also to historic periods. From the first quarter of 2020 Luminor \\r\\nstarted applying Activity Based Costing to allocate personnel costs, administrative costs and depreciation between operating segments \\r\\nand restatement was also made to segment split of costs to 2019 figures. The asymmetrical allocation of allowance for impairment Net \\r\\nimpairment (losses/reversal) on loans to customers, as described above, was applied from the second quarter of 2020. Comparative \\r\\ninformation for Loans and Advances as of 31 December 2019 was changed accordingly. \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Corporate Retail \\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement \\r\\nOther Total

Our responsibility is to express a \\r\\nconclusion on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements based on our review. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nScope of review  \\r\\n \\r\\nWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) \\r\\n(Estonia) 2410, \\'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the \\r\\nEntity\\'. A review of condensed consolidated interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, \\r\\nprimarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other \\r\\nreview procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with \\r\\nInternational Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we \\r\\nwould become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do \\r\\nnot express an audit opinion. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion  \\r\\n \\r\\nBased on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the \\r\\naccompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material \\r\\nrespects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, \\'Interim Financial Reporting\\' as \\r\\nadopted by the European Union. \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAS PricewaterhouseCoopers \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAgo Vilu \\r\\nAuditor’s certificate no.325 \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n17 August 2020 \\r\\nTallinn, Estonia \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tCEO Comment\\r\\n\\tManagement report\\r\\n\\tGeneral information\\r\\n\\tMacroeconomic overview\\r\\n\\tCOVID-19 impact on Luminor\\r\\n\\tBusiness development\\r\\n\\tProduct and digital development\\r\\n\\tthe retail banking segment\\r\\n\\tthe corporate banking segment\\r\\n\\tthe WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT\\r\\n\\tCorporate social responsibility\\r\\n\\tEFFORTS TO PREVENT Financial crime\\r\\n\\tother events\\r\\n\\tevents after 30 june\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFinancial results\\r\\n\\tlending and deposits\\r\\n\\tASSET QUALITY FOR Q2 2020\\r\\n\\tFUNDING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOn 13 September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, with a stable outlook.

Looking out for the health and safety of our employees and customers continued to be our major concern, while at \\r\\nthe same time using our strong financial standing for the benefit of Luminor customers. We have strengthened our \\r\\norganisational capabilities and are constantly working with different scenarios for how the crisis may evolve and the economic \\r\\nimpact it may have.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic economies were strong when they entered the pandemic and they have demonstrated greater stability and flexibility \\r\\nthroughout it than the euro area average, experiencing the mildest economic downturn in the EU. Cooperation between \\r\\ndifferent stakeholders in the public and private sectors has been successful in providing support to customers, proving that \\r\\ngood results can be achieved through collaboration.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued into the second half of the year with a strong funding base and improved profitability. By the end of \\r\\nSeptember, we had reduced further the share of non-performing loans, lowering them to 3.7% of the loan portfolio. Over the \\r\\npast year the loans-to-deposits ratio strengthened from 108% to 87%. The improved funding structure and reduced lending \\r\\nvolumes that have been achieved over time have made it possible for Luminor to become fully self-funded with no outstanding \\r\\nfunding from its former parent banks as of the end of September 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe headway that was made towards becoming a fully standalone bank was also supported by continuous progress in the carve-\\r\\nout of services from the DNB and Nordea systems across all three countries. We are already operating technology platforms in \\r\\nLatvia and Lithuania that are fully independent of the systems of either DNB or Nordea. In the third quarter, we launched the \\r\\nnew banking platform for internal pilot users in Estonia and made preparations for the market launch and migration of all of \\r\\nour Estonian customers, which is planned for the fourth quarter of this year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter, Luminor’s Retail Banking focused on business growth and on improving the customer experience. The \\r\\npositive trends in the market and in the overall outlook were evidenced by the interest customers showed in taking mortgages, \\r\\nwhich was greater than before the pandemic, and by sales of consumer loans, which reached their pre-pandemic level in the \\r\\nthird quarter. The volume of deposits in the Retail Banking segment increased by 41 million EUR, a significant step up from the \\r\\nfall of 24 million EUR in the same period last year. Luminor’s Corporate Banking expanded their lending book by 78 million EUR \\r\\nin the third quarter and disbursed several new large investment loans.  The third quarter also saw significant growth in \\r\\ninvestment volumes for the Private Banking segment with investment assets up 13% on the same quarter of 2019 and 8% on \\r\\nthe previous quarter. Pension assets increased by 6% in comparison with the year before and 1.8% with the previous quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is continuously vigilant about financial crime and is committed to preventing, detecting and reporting it. In the third \\r\\nquarter we established the Customer Risk Management Department, streamlining anti-financial crime and sanctions risks \\r\\nmanagement. We also introduced an improved solution for online monitoring of transactions in the third quarter of 2020.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s story is a story of change. In the three years since Luminor was created, we have undergone a unique transformation. \\r\\nThere is one more considerable effort ahead of us, which is the migration of our Estonian customers to the new technological \\r\\nplatform and new banking channels. Then we will be in the long-awaited position where we can start the next stage of our \\r\\ntransformation process, the stage of growth.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCreating Luminor has been a singular and intense experience. Sometimes we need to pass on the baton so that we can keep up \\r\\nthe pace and energy that are needed for this journey. In order to ensure that Luminor has the best possible leader with the \\r\\nskills, experience and energy that best suit our new stage of transformation, I suggested to the Supervisory Council that they \\r\\nshould start looking for such a leader to steer the next stages of Luminor’s development.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI am convinced that Peter Bosek, the new CEO of Luminor who will start in this position in the new year, is the best person to \\r\\nsteer the next stage of our transformation and that the bank will reach many new milestones under his leadership, which will \\r\\nfirst of all benefit our customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor will continue as a strong Baltic bank. We are a bank that was created for local customers and the local community and \\r\\nwe will invest all our energy in continually improving our customer experience and in developing our products and services.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 4  \\r\\n\\r\\nI want to thank our team, our customers, and our investors for choosing Luminor as a partner on this journey.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been an honour. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\n\\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 5  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral information \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor) was established on 1 October 2017 through the merger of the Baltic operations of DNB Bank ASA \\r\\n(Commercial Register no. 984 851 006, DNB) and Nordea Bank Abp (Commercial Register no. 2858394-9, Nordea) to create a \\r\\nnew-generation financial service provider for local businesses and financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 it was announced that the transaction signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB, Nordea and US-\\r\\nbased private equity firm Blackstone had been concluded and as a result a consortium led by private equity funds managed by \\r\\nBlackstone acquired a 60.1% majority stake in the bank. The bank’s initial owners Nordea and DNB each retained a 19.95% \\r\\nequity stake in Luminor, but an arrangement has been made by the consortium and Nordea for the purchase of Nordea’s \\r\\nremaining stake over the coming years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with some 900 000 clients, 2 355 employees, and market \\r\\nshare of 16.3% in deposits and 17.4% in lending as at the end of September 2020. Luminor has total shareholders’ equity of 1.6 \\r\\nbillion EUR and it is capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 22.0%. Luminor’s core business is serving entrepreneurial people in the \\r\\nBaltics with a primary focus on local companies and the financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers its customers a wide range of products and services through all possible channels, digital and physical, with 34 \\r\\ncustomer service centres in total in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, of which seven are meet-up points. Luminor owns 363 ATMs \\r\\nthroughout the Baltic states, and additionally provides services through 100 ATMs in partnership with other financial services \\r\\nproviders.  \\r\\n\\r\\n30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Estonia Latvia Lithuania GroupGr Total  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of customers ~128 000 ~219 000 ~550 000 ~897 000 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket shares      \\r\\n\\r\\nLending 12.2% 22.0% 19.5% 17.4% \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits 9.3% 15.8% 22.0% 16.3% \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of client service \\r\\ncentres, including meet- \\r\\nup points \\r\\n\\r\\n8 10 16 34  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of employees 566 831 958 2 355 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe spread of coronavirus in the Baltic states has been more limited than in euro area peers, on average. As a consequence, the \\r\\neconomies of the three states were less impacted by COVID-19 than other parts of Europe. In the second quarter, real GDP \\r\\ncontracted by 6.5% over the year in Estonia, 8.6% in Latvia and 4.0% in Lithuania, as compared to an average fall of 14.7% in \\r\\nthe euro area. Despite the uncertainty created by coronavirus, the volume of retail trade exceeded its level of the previous year \\r\\nas early as May in Estonia and Lithuania, with Latvia exceeding its pre-crisis level in June. Industrial production for August was \\r\\ndown 5% over the year in Estonia and 3% in Latvia, while in Lithuania it was up 2.1% on its level of last year. In comparison, \\r\\nproduction volumes in the euro area were down 7%. \\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer confidence was supported by stronger balance sheets ahead of the pandemic, with accumulated savings and modest \\r\\nleverage, to social transfers, and wage growth. There were no external imbalances to correct during the current pandemic as \\r\\nthe Baltic states have run substantial external surpluses and close to balance budget positions in the past decade.  However the \\r\\npurchase of durables continues to lag the more general economy recovery. New car sales are down on average by 30% at \\r\\npresent. \\r\\n\\r\\nLooking forward, the prospects of recovery for the open economies of the Baltic states will depend on how the global economy \\r\\nand key export markets in Europe recover. The recovery will benefit from substantial fiscal support, non-financial sector and \\r\\nstate liquidity buffers, and the EU pandemic and structural funds. Furthermore, a well-capitalised financial sector that is allowed \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 6  \\r\\n\\r\\nto refinance loans and extend new credit to the non-financial sector will be crucial for the outlook for future growth. Even with \\r\\na substantial discretionary fiscal boost, debt levels in the Baltic states will remain the lowest among euro area members. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe impact of COVID-19 on Luminor \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter we continued to apply all the measures needed to look after the safety and well-being of our staff and \\r\\ncustomers in the face of COVID-19. These include encouraging remote work, paying extra attention to cleaning and the \\r\\navailability of disinfectants in our offices and branches, and providing protective equipment to our customer-facing employees.    \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also continued our efforts to promote remote services and we introduced a system of pre-booked visits in our customer \\r\\nservice centres so we could minimise physical contacts and safe-guard against COVID-19. We have expanded our remote \\r\\nservices to support pre-booking in our client service centres so that customers can have the majority of their questions \\r\\nanswered already remotely. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll Luminor employees are regularly informed about all current guidelines, restrictions and recommendations so that they can \\r\\nkeep themselves and their customers safe and help prevent the spread of the virus. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are monitoring the situation closely and are ready to adjust our work and processes swiftly if the pandemic should require \\r\\nus to do that.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the pandemic Luminor has supported its customers when needed, including by providing temporary grace periods \\r\\nfor principal loan payments when this has been required by the customers. As at the end of third quarter of 2020, grace periods \\r\\nhad been granted to customers representing 14.5% of the corporate loan portfolio across the Baltics, which was 0.2% less than \\r\\nin the adjusted second quarter, and 8.4% of the mortgage portfolio, or 0.3% more than in the second quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness development \\r\\n\\r\\nThe transformation of Luminor continued in the third quarter. Some further adjustments were made in the operational \\r\\nstructure to support a more efficient organisation and prepare for the next stage of our development. \\r\\n\\r\\nProgress has been made in the carve-out of services from the DNB and Nordea systems across all three countries. In Latvia and \\r\\nLithuania Luminor finalised the migration of customers to a common banking platforms, which are fully independent of the \\r\\nsystems of either DNB or Nordea. Work to complete the migration and decommission of historical data is underway.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new banking platform in Estonia was launched in the third quarter for internal pilot-users and preparations were made to \\r\\nlaunch the update in October, as well as to carry out the market launch and customer migration also planned for the fourth \\r\\nquarter of 2020.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter we continued extending and strengthening our remote customer onboarding capabilities. Having already \\r\\ndone so in Latvia and Lithuania, we launched private customer remote onboarding in Estonia, and introduced technical and \\r\\nprocess improvements across all three countries to improve customer experience and ensure quality of the service. The share \\r\\nof private customers onboarded remotely grew to 18% by the end of September 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor Investor platform, which was launched at the end of last year in Latvia and Lithuania and at the beginning of the \\r\\nyear in Estonia, has attracted 28 million EUR of new assets as at the end of the third quarter,  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have concluded 315 agreements with customers for the e-Commerce Gateway, which was launched for Mass Business \\r\\ncustomers at the end of the first quarter of 2020. The e-Commerce Gateway provides card acquiring services that let businesses \\r\\naccept VISA and Mastercard cards, and it uses the Open Banking application programming interfaces (APIs) of major banks so \\r\\nthat account-to-account payments can be acquired. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus of Retail Banking in the third quarter centred on the three pillars of mortgage loans, consumer loans and new \\r\\ncustomer acquisition.  \\r\\n \\r\\nVolumes of new sales of mortgages were up by 6% on the previous quarter. Interest from customers in taking mortgages was \\r\\ngreater than before the pandemic, aided by the reduction in restrictions on new lending introduced in response to COVID-19. A \\r\\nnew credit risk strategy was developed to adjust to the market situation, while continuous improvements were made to the \\r\\nnew and existing customer experience in lending consultations, the application process and interactions around contracts. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 7  \\r\\n\\r\\nSales of consumer loans increased to their pre-COVID level in the third quarter, with volumes of new sales up by 3 million EUR \\r\\non the previous quarter. The new credit risk strategy was introduced, and COVID-19 lending restrictions were reduced. \\r\\nDeposits increased by 41 million EUR, as compared to a decrease of 24 million EUR in the same period last year. \\r\\n \\r\\nAs the pandemic stabilised during the summer, a consumer loan campaign was launched in the third quarter that was targeted \\r\\nat home improvement. A campaign to gain new private customers was launched, promoting the new Luminor Black payment \\r\\ncard and awareness of the remote onboarding process in the Latvian and Lithuanian markets.  \\r\\n \\r\\nThe customer service centres of Liepkalnis and Žirmūnai in Vilnius, Lithuania, were relocated to Paupys and reopened with a \\r\\nnew concept. For customer convenience, the new centre is designed not only for financial consultations, but also for events and \\r\\nseminars.  \\r\\n \\r\\nRetail Banking continued with the transformation process in the third quarter to support the next stage of growth and focus on \\r\\ndigital daily services by redesigning the customer service process and advisory concept, and optimising channels and the \\r\\norganisational structure. \\r\\n \\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Corporate Banking segment increased market activities in the third quarter, expanding lending by 78 million EUR.  A \\r\\nhealthy increase was observed in the use of overdrafts, especially in seasonal activity among grain wholesalers. Several new, \\r\\nlarge investment loans were drawn, notably in the commercial real estate segment.   \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit volumes increased by 718 million EUR on the back of large increases in public sector deposits. The introduction of \\r\\nnegative deposit rates was communicated to the largest depositors in September, and these started to apply from 1 October \\r\\n2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nPension assets stood at 1.4 billion EUR, which was 6% more than a year earlier and 1.8% more than in the previous quarter. By \\r\\nthe end of the third quarter, Luminor had some 289 000 second pillar pension customers and 62 000 third pillar customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe third quarter of 2020 saw significant growth of investment volumes for the Private Banking segment. Investment assets \\r\\nwere up 13% on the same quarter of 2019 and 8% on the previous quarter.    \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor Investor platform and Portfolio Management continue to offer preferred investment services in combination with \\r\\nthe high-quality Private Banking service.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe safety and well-being of Luminor employees and customers continued to be the top priority in the third quarter of 2020 in \\r\\nall the bank’s activities. Promoting and supporting remote services and e-business was very much in focus in the corporate \\r\\nsocial responsibility area as well.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued in the third quarter with the community investment project by developing a dedicated knowledge and \\r\\ntraining hub that can support local companies and organisations in taking their activities online and advancing their current e-\\r\\nbusiness capabilities.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWorking with the Ethnographic Open-Air Museum of Latvia, Luminor introduced the e-fair platform egadatirgus.lv so that the \\r\\n50th season of the Latvian applied arts folk fair could happen and supported local merchants with an e-commerce gateway \\r\\nsolution. The event had 178 merchants registered and 15 000 unique visitors. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo contribute to a wider discussion on developing the Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) framework, Luminor \\r\\nparticipated in a comprehensive ESG integration study carried out at the initiative of the European Commission among banks \\r\\nfrom all the EU countries. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo promote equality and diversity further in the workplace, Luminor adopted an updated Equality, Non-discrimination, and \\r\\nDiversity Policy in the third quarter.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial focus was put on promoting information security and data protection among the bank’s customers and on warning them \\r\\nagainst possible fraudsters. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo promote governance enhancement, governance ownership was transferred to come under the direct supervision of the CEO \\r\\nin the third quarter, to ensure that due focus is turned on this important topic.  Adjustments were also made in Corporate \\r\\nGovernance to align it with the new risk policies and to support the new suitability assessment process. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 8  \\r\\n\\r\\nEFFORTS TO PREVENT FINANCIAL CRIME  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are committed to preventing, detecting and reporting financial crime.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe regularly review our anti-financial crime (AFC) practices and invest in the human and technological resources that are \\r\\nneeded. We work constantly to get a better understanding of our customers and their transactions, and to manage and report \\r\\nany potential financial crime risk. Luminor predominantly serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers who \\r\\nhave a strong personal or business connection to the Baltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, Luminor continued to apply its financial crime risk management framework in order to \\r\\nprevent, detect, manage and report potential financial crime, and this was supported by its conservative approach towards \\r\\nmoney laundering and financial crime. The framework covers the technology, policies and procedures employed to prevent and \\r\\ndetect financial crime, assess risks, run training and awareness-raising, and monitor new and developing financial crime risks \\r\\ncontinuously.  \\r\\n\\r\\nStarting from the third quarter Luminor has transformed the Customer Data Quality Middle Office into the Customer Risk \\r\\nManagement Department by segregating duties between the first and second lines of defence to streamline anti-financial crime \\r\\noperational controls and the sound risk management practices aligned with the appropriate governance set-up.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is a subject to a wide range of legal requirements, and so we are transparent in all our activities and we work closely \\r\\nwith all the supervisory and regulatory authorities. Luminor also follows the international guidelines, recommendations and \\r\\nstandards issued by the regulatory and supervisory authorities, international bodies, local banking associations, and financial \\r\\nintelligence units in each Baltic state.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to invest in systems and processes so we can adapt in a constantly changing environment - an example is \\r\\nthe improved solution for online transaction monitoring that was introduced in the third quarter of 2020. The bank is \\r\\ndeveloping further its common monitoring and screening solution in all three Baltic states and has approved several additional \\r\\ndevelopments that will be delivered during 2020 and 2021.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor considers that work to raise awareness is an important component of the financial crime risk management framework. \\r\\nIn the third quarter, 16 training events related to AFC and corporate compliance areas were held on 11 different topics.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER EVENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nJohan Pedersson Lilliehöök resigned from the Supervisory Council of Luminor Bank AS, effective 1 August 2020. Mathias Favetto \\r\\nhas been appointed to the Supervisory Council as the shareholder representative of Blackstone, effective 26 August 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nIndrek Heinloo has resigned as the Head of the Programme Office and Member of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS, \\r\\neffective 1 September 2020. Following the near completion of Luminor’s New Bank Programme, the Programme Office has been \\r\\nmerged with the Technology Division under its current management. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 September 2020 it was announced that Erkki Raasuke, Chief Executive Officer, will leave the group effective 1 January \\r\\n2021, ahead of the next stage of Luminor’s evolution. Luminor has appointed Peter Bosek as Chief Executive Officer, effective 1 \\r\\nJanuary 2021. Erkki Raasuke will continue to lead the company in the interim period. \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 30 SEPTEMBER \\r\\n\\r\\nJonas Eriksson resigned as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Member of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS effective \\r\\n10 October 2020. The bank announced Eriksson’s decision to resign on 17 August 2020. The Supervisory Council of the bank \\r\\nhas commenced a comprehensive search process for a new CFO. Until a new CFO is appointed, Erkki Raasuke, Chairman of the \\r\\nManagement Board, will oversee responsibility for the bank’s finance function at the Management Board level, supported by \\r\\nOlof Sundblad, Head of Treasury, who will be acting CFO during the interim period. \\r\\n\\r\\nEffective 1 October 2020 the Wealth Management Division was merged with the Retail Banking Division under its current \\r\\nmanagement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the end of the third quarter and the reporting date, Luminor exited one credit. This decreased its non-performing loan \\r\\nportfolio by 40 million EUR. As a result, the previously recognized loan losses decreased by 9 million EUR. \\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 9  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit in the third quarter was 22.2 million EUR, 5.3 million EUR more than in the same quarter of last year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income was 58.2 million EUR having been 64.6 million EUR in the same quarter last year. This decline is explained \\r\\nby the our strategy to reprice and rightsize the balance sheet, which has seen the loans-to-deposits ratio move from 108% to \\r\\n87% over the past year. Net commission income was 1% more than in the same quarter of last year, showing the recovery of \\r\\neconomic activity after COVID-19. Net other operating income was lower than in the same quarter of last year, mainly because of \\r\\nthe non-recurrence of income from the sale of an office building in the third quarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses were 63.5 million EUR, which is 8.0 million EUR less than a year earlier. Exceptional costs in the third \\r\\nquarter reached 20.6 million EUR, 22% (5.8 million EUR) less than the comparable exceptional costs for the same period last \\r\\nyear*, as the significant systems consolidation and customer migration project neared completion. The largest part of the \\r\\nexceptional costs in the third quarter of this year were IT expenses, which constituted 77% of the total, while staff costs were \\r\\nanother 19%. Total operating expenses excluding exceptional costs were  5% lower in the third quarter than in the same period \\r\\nlast year.

Luminor’s \\r\\nexposure towards these sectors is small at 0.6% of the total net lending to customers. Almost half of the net exposure within \\r\\nthese affected sectors is classified as Stage 1 exposure, about 20% is Stage 2 and some 30% is Stage 3.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have supported our customers through the pandemic notably via loan modifications. The most common modification \\r\\nrequested was a grace period on principal payments. Grace period on principal and interest payments was granted only in \\r\\nexceptional circumstances, and to around 1% of all modifications. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe stock of the requests for modifications including grace periods stood at 1.1 billion EUR at the end of the third quarter and \\r\\ncovered 11% of the total credit portfolio, which is almost the same as at the end of the second quarter. The flow of modification \\r\\nrequests has almost stopped, with only a small flow remaining for mortgage loans, where modification requests increased by \\r\\n16 million EUR in the third quarter. The total value of modifications approved reached almost 1.0 billion EUR at the end of \\r\\nSeptember 2020. From the above mentioned received and approved modification requests grace periods have already expired \\r\\nfor around 36% of the modified exposures, and this has not led to any noticeable changes in overdue loans within these \\r\\nexposures. The level of exposures overdue by more than 5 days after the end of the grace period is only slightly higher, by just \\r\\n0.4 percentage point, than it is in the portfolio without modifications. The largest concentration for the end of grace periods is \\r\\nin October 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome 64% of the requests for modifications came from business customers. The largest part of the requests from business \\r\\ncustomers for modifications came from industries like real estate activities, transportation and storage, wholesale and retail \\r\\ntrade, and manufacturing. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s loan loss provision reversals, including provisions for off-balance sheet commitments, reached 0.3 million EUR \\r\\nduring the third quarter. An increase in individual provisions for the reclassification of one larger COVID-19 related exposure \\r\\nfrom Stage 2 to Stage 3 and another exposure in the subsidised energy industry were offset by a positive outcome from the \\r\\nresolution of other legacy non-performing exposures and a reduction in Stage 2 provisions. The loan loss provisions excluding \\r\\nthe off-balance sheet commitments were 29.6 million EUR for the first half of the year, bringing the total for the first nine months \\r\\nof 2020 to 29.0 million EUR. The loan loss provisions for off-balance sheet commitments reached 3.1 million EUR, bringing the \\r\\ntotal loan loss provisions to 32.1 million EUR for the first nine months of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe share of non-performing loans, or the NPL ratio, was 3.7% at the end of the quarter, which is 0.3 percentage point lower \\r\\nthan in the previous quarter. Even though the COVID-19 driven inflow continued in the third quarter, the outflow was more \\r\\nthan three times the inflow, and this left the volume of non-performing loans at its historically lowest level ever. The key drivers \\r\\nfor the decrease in the non-performing portfolio were collection activities including sales of collaterals, sales of claim rights, \\r\\nand write-offs of the amounts remaining after collection activities. The NPL ratio for the mortgage loan portfolio was 2.6%, \\r\\nwhich represents a decrease of 0.4 percentage point. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal allowances for expected credit losses on the balance sheet were 176.6 million EUR at the end of the quarter, of which \\r\\n126.9 million EUR were for Stage 3 exposures. Non-performing loans totalled 361.7 million EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n

This has been achieved over time \\r\\nby reducing lending volumes and by improving the funding structure.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers stood at 11 070 million EUR at the end of the third quarter, and at 10 344 million EUR at the end of \\r\\nthe second quarter. In addition the total nominal value of the bonds outstanding under the Euro Medium Term Note or EMTN \\r\\nprogramme was 1 150 million EUR, consisting of 650 million EUR of senior unsecured bonds and a five-year 500 million EUR \\r\\ncovered bond. There were no new issuances during the third quarter. In September 2020 Luminor doubled the Cover Pool of \\r\\nits covered bonds by adding a portfolio of Latvian mortgage loans.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a committed funding facility agreement with its former parent banks, DNB and Nordea, that is provided in the \\r\\nform of a syndicate, with each partner in the syndicate providing 50% of the funding. At the end of the third quarter the total \\r\\nfacility stood at 1 037 million EUR and was undrawn. The total commitment was reduced by 1 300 million EUR during the third \\r\\nquarter following a voluntary cancellation by Luminor. The amount of the facility has been committed for five years from 1 \\r\\nOctober 2019, with an initial commitment for three years and the option for Luminor to extend it by up to two years, and it can \\r\\nbe drawn with maturities of one, two or three years. The facility is partly secured, as Luminor had assigned mortgage loans to \\r\\nit with a carrying value of 1 034 million EUR at the end of the third quarter of 2020 and of 1 667 million EUR at the end of the \\r\\nsecond quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nStructure of Liabilities and Equity: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 April 2020 Luminor received its minimum own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) requirement in a decision of the Single \\r\\nResolution Board (the SRB) dated 20 December 2019 that was executed for Luminor by a decision of the Estonian Financial \\r\\nSupervision and Resolution Authority, dated 1 April 2020. The MREL decision sets the following MREL requirements for \\r\\nLuminor: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Holding AS (the parent company of Luminor Bank AS) shall comply with the MREL at the consolidated level of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS of 17.28% of total liabilities and own funds at all times, and 11.97% of total liabilities and own funds \\r\\nshall be met with subordinated instruments; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Holding AS shall have a transitional period until 30 June 2022 to comply with these requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at the end of the third quarter of 2020 the total MREL ratio stood at 15.9% at the consolidated level of Luminor Bank AS, down \\r\\nfrom 16.6% at the end of the second quarter, while 11.3% of total liabilities and own funds were subordinated instruments as at \\r\\nthe end of the third quarter of 2020 and 11.8% of total liabilities and own funds were subordinated instruments as at the end of \\r\\nthe second quarter of 2020. It should be noted that the MREL requirements (set versus Total Liabilities and Own Funds) were \\r\\nset using data as of 31 March 2019, which means the decision (and thus the requirement) does not consider any subsequent \\r\\nevents impacting the capital requirements and thus also the MREL requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 17  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of \\r\\nBaa1/Prime-2, with a stable outlook. There have been no changes to Luminor’s ratings since then. On 25 September 2020 \\r\\nMoody’s issued an updated credit opinion for Luminor.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 March 2020 Moody’s assigned a definitive Aa1 rating to the mortgage covered bonds issued by Luminor Bank AS under \\r\\nthe Estonian Covered Bonds Act. \\r\\n\\r\\n  LIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s structural liquidity risk is conservative and well-balanced, and it is based on metrics that measure liquidity risk and \\r\\nis appropriately adapted to the current economic and regulatory environment. Luminor uses a range of metrics to measure \\r\\nliquidity risk, one of which is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The LCR for Luminor was 177% at the end of the third quarter \\r\\nof 2020 and 159% at the end of the second quarter under the definition of the LCR given in the Capital Requirements Regulation \\r\\n(CRR). The ratio increased as liquidity increased because lending volumes were lower. The liquidity buffer is composed of highly \\r\\nliquid central-bank-eligible securities and cash. Long-term liquidity risk is measured as the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). \\r\\nLuminor’s NSFR rose to 144% during the third quarter of 2020 from 133% at the end of the second quarter. The improvement \\r\\nwas driven by the increased deposit base benefiting the Available Stable Funding (AFS) and by the decrease in the amount of \\r\\nRequired Stable Funding (RSF). The RSF was impacted mainly by a reduction of the funding facility commitment lowering the \\r\\namount of encumbered assets. \\r\\n\\r\\n Q3 2020 Q2  2020 Q1  2020 Q4 2019 Q3  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 177.2% 159.0% 143.7% 149.8% 144.3% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR 143.6% 133.2% 126.0% 123.0% 118.0% \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are predominantly from residents of the Baltics.

Risk Exposure Amount (REA) was at 7 221 \\r\\nmillion EUR (31 December 2019: 7 969 million EUR). As at the end of the third quarter of 2020 Luminor had 1 588 million EUR \\r\\nin own funds and they were fully composed of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, meaning the Tier 1 and total capital ratios \\r\\nof Luminor stood at the same level as the CET1 ratio.  \\r\\n\\r\\n0.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.1%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.1% 1.1%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.4%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.5% 0.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.7%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.8%0.7%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.9%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.4%\\r\\n\\r\\nBaltic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania Other EU Non-EU \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 18  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with the CRR, was 10.7% as at the end of the third quarter of 2020.

The bonus share \\r\\nissue is based on the bank’s interim balance sheet as at January 2, 2019 and involves a partial conversion of share premium in the amount of \\r\\n216 030 920 EUR into share capital. Following the bonus issue, the share capital of the bank has been reduced by the same amount and was \\r\\npaid out to the shareholders in September 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 24  \\r\\n\\r\\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Notes \\r\\n1 January 2020 to \\r\\n\\r\\n30 September 2020 \\r\\n1 January 2019 to \\r\\n\\r\\n30 September 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flows from operating activities       \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit before tax   14 961 55 172 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustment for:     \\r\\n\\r\\n-Net impairment (-)/ reversal (+) on loans to customers, excluding off-balance sheet \\r\\ncommitments \\r\\n\\r\\n3 28 995 12 273 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Net impairment (-)/ reversal (+) on off-balance sheet commitments  3 095 -1 106 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Dividend income   -35 -58 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Share of profit from an associate   -1 025 0 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Loss (+) / profit (-) from foreign currency revaluation   606 10 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Depreciation, amortisation and impairment   8 930 10 051 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Other adjustments   50 1 605 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Interest income  4 -205 458 -227 866 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Interest expenses  4 35 611 31 122 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from operations before changes in operating assets/liabilities   -114 270 -118 797 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in operating assets/liabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of lending to customers   569 089 738 539 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of other assets   -24 227 -52 054 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (+) / decrease (-) of client deposits 12, 13  883 652 -1 757 951 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of liabilities   -37 778 46 339 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest received   200 696 228 949 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest paid   -33 819 -28 040 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncome tax paid   -10 818 -5 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from operating activites   1 546 795 -829 425 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nInvesting activities     \\r\\n\\r\\nAcquisition of property, equipment and intangible assets   -2 369 -5 757 \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from disposal of property, equipment and intangible assets  1 426 1 985 \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from disposals of investment property  1 208 14 902 \\r\\n\\r\\nDividend received   35 58 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from investing activities   300 11 188 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancing activities     \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 14  503 500 298 809 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayment of principal of parent funding \\r\\n                          \\r\\n\\r\\n12 \\r\\n-1 155 000 0 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 25  \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from parent funding 12 250 000 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments of principal on leases   -1 750 -2 953 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayout to the Shareholder  0 -216 031 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flows from financing activities   -403 250 79 825 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nNet increase (+) / decrease (-) in cash and cash equivalents   1 029 575 -857 209 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period  8,9 2 952 815 3 310 517 \\r\\n\\r\\nEffects of currency translation on cash and cash equivalents   -606 -10 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet increase (+) / decrease (-) in cash and cash equivalents   1 029 575 -857 209 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period   3 981 784 2 453 298 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents comprises     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash on hand  8 129 043 119 844 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-restricted  current account  with central bank  8 3 755 193 2 165 891 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions on demand or with original maturity of three \\r\\nmonths or less \\r\\n\\r\\n 9 97 548 167 563 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   3 981 784 2 453 298 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 26  \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL \\r\\nSTATEMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\n1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE INFORMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) is a local credit institution whose parent company is Luminor Holding AS \\r\\nthat is ultimately controlled by BCP VII, an investment fund managed by an affiliate of Blackstone Group Inc. Other shareholders \\r\\nof Luminor Holding AS - Nordea Bank Abp and DNB BANK ASA - are considered to be the entities with significant influence over \\r\\nthe Group. The Luminor Bank’s registered legal address is Liivalaia 45, 10145, Tallinn, Republic of Estonia. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Holding AS, established on 14 May 2019, is the parent company of Luminor Bank AS since 23 September 2019. Until 23 \\r\\nSeptember 2019 the parent company was Luminor Group AB. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor Bank AS has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries \\r\\nthrough the Estonian registered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone acquired a 60.1% majority stake in the \\r\\nLuminor Holding AS, the owner of Luminor Bank AS. Luminor Bank AS previous owners, Nordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB \\r\\nBANK ASA (\"DNB\"), each retained a 19.95% equity stake in the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current interim report, “Bank” (or Luminor Bank AS) refers to Luminor Bank AS. “Group” refers to the consolidated \\r\\nfinancial statements of Luminor Bank AS and its subsidiaries.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 September 2020 Luminor Bank AS directly or indirectly owned majority in the following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country Republic of \\r\\nEstonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country Republic of Latvia: Registered country Republic of \\r\\nLithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Liising AS  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Pensions Estonia AS \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Promano Estonia OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Asset Management IPAS \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Finance SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Līzings SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Realm SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 2 SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 3 SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 4 SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 6 SIA  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Trioleta SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Baltic ipasums SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Industrius UAB (under \\r\\nliquidation) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Intractus UAB \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Promano Lit UAB (under \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Recurso UAB (under \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Investiciju Valdymas \\r\\nUAB \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Lizingas UAB \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 September 2020 Luminor Bank AS had ownership in the following associated companies: \\r\\n\\uf0b7 ALD Automotive AS (25%)  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 ALD Automotive SIA (25%) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 ALD Automotive UAB (25%) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 SIA Kredītinformācijas Birojs (22,61%) \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) was prepared \\r\\nin accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU. The condensed consolidated interim financial \\r\\ninformation does not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read \\r\\nin conjunction with the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 27  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are consistent \\r\\nwith those followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, \\r\\nexcept for the adoption of new standards effective as of 1 January 2020. The Group has not early adopted any standard, \\r\\ninterpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. Several amendments and interpretations apply for the \\r\\nfirst time in 2020, but do not have a material impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS Interpretation Committee agenda decision regarding deferred tax related to investments in subsidiaries \\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Estonia and Latvia have replaced the traditional profit-based tax regimes with distribution-based tax regimes where \\r\\ncorporate income tax is not payable on profit but rather on distribution of dividends. In accordance with IAS 12.52A and 57A, in \\r\\ndistribution-based tax regimes no current or deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of undistributed profits until a liability \\r\\nto pay dividends is recognised. As a market practice in Estonia, this accounting policy has been applied consistently to all \\r\\nundistributed profits in the group, regardless of whether those profits accumulated in the parent or in the subsidiaries. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2020, IFRS Interpretation Committee made an agenda decision where it concluded that the principle set out in IAS 12.52A \\r\\nand 57A only applies to undistributed profits accumulated in the parent company and does not apply to undistributed profits \\r\\naccumulated in the subsidiaries. Instead, the principles described in IAS 12.39-40 should be followed in respect of undistributed \\r\\nprofits in subsidiaries, stipulating that a deferred tax shall be recognized in respect of such accumulated profits, unless it is \\r\\nprobable that they will not be distributed to the parent in the foreseeable future. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is currently assessing the potential impact of the IFRS Interpretation Committee agenda decision on its financial \\r\\nstatements and will reflect the impact, if any, in its 2020 annual financial statements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group presents financial information in interim report in the same format as it was presented in the annual financial \\r\\nstatements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019, except for several changes in classification within the \\r\\nConsolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as described below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in presentation \\r\\n\\r\\nContent of statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income has been reviewed for the Interm Report. Based on the \\r\\nreview results reclassifications were made for better understanding of the presented financial information. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 28  \\r\\n\\r\\nReclassification was made for following statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income items:  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\n1 January 2019  \\r\\nto 30 September 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nQ3 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nAs restated Change \\r\\nAs \\r\\n\\r\\npreviously \\r\\nreported \\r\\n\\r\\nAs \\r\\nrestated \\r\\n\\r\\nChange \\r\\nAs \\r\\n\\r\\npreviously \\r\\nreported \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest income calculated using the effective interest \\r\\nmethod \\r\\n\\r\\n184 415 +1 353 183 062 61 746 +269 61 477 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther similar income 43 451 -1 353 44 804 14 267 -269 14 536 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest and similar expense* -31 122 +7 546 -38 668 -11 424 +2 485 -13 909 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther operating expenses* -7 546 -7 546 0 -2 485 -2 485 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet gain on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair \\r\\nvalue through profit/loss \\r\\n\\r\\n480 -731 1 211 91 -204 295 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet gain on debt securities at fair value through profit or \\r\\nloss \\r\\n\\r\\n731 +731 0 204 +204 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet gain on financial assets and liabilities held for trading 3 868 -13 882 17 750 -2 341 -13 077 10 736 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet gain from financial derivatives 13 882 +13 882 0 13 077 +13 077 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther operating expenses** 0 +11 709 -11 709 0 +3 131 -3 131 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther administrative expenses** -114 197 -11 709 -102 488 -42 444 -3 131 -39 313 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther non-operating expenses -1 605 -1 106 -499 -143 -1 936 1 793 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (-) / reversal (+) on off-balance sheet \\r\\ncommitments \\r\\n\\r\\n1 106 +1 106 0 1 936 +1 936 0 \\r\\n\\r\\n*Cash contributions to resolution funds and quarantee schemas \\r\\n** Reclassification of other operating expenses to other administrative expenses due to review results which showed that by nature these \\r\\nexpenses were administrative expenses rather than operating expenses (legal expenses and VAT taxes, for example).  \\r\\n \\r\\nReclassification impacted the following condensed consolidated statement of cashflows items:  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n1 January 2019  \\r\\n\\r\\nto 30 September 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n As restated Change \\r\\nAs previously \\r\\n\\r\\nreported \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest and similar expense* 31 122 -7 546 38 668 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest paid -28 040 +7 546 -35 586 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (-) / reversal (+) on off-balance sheet commitments -1106 -1 106 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther adjustments 1605 +1 106 499 \\r\\n\\r\\n*Cash contributions to resolution funds and quarantee schemas \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and applies assumptions that affect the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements \\r\\nand the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on \\r\\nmanagement’s experience and expectations of future events. \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognizes credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The Standard applies a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) \\r\\napproach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not \\r\\nheld at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The assets \\r\\nto test for impairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes assets where \\r\\nthere has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or which are classified as low credit risk (credit rating \\r\\nindicating investment grade). The allowances for stage 1 assets are based on the expected credit losses associated with the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 29  \\r\\n\\r\\nprobability of default in the next twelve months (12-month expected credit loss). Stage 2 includes assets where there has been a \\r\\nsignificant increase in credit risk. The allowances for stage 2 assets are based on the expected credit losses associated with the \\r\\nprobability of default over the life of the asset (lifetime expected credit losses). Stage 3 includes credit-impaired (defaulted) \\r\\nassets, and the allowances reflect the lifetime expected credit losses. Material assets in stage 3 are tested for impairment on an \\r\\nindividual basis, while for immaterial stage 3 assets a collective assessment is performed. Loss allowances based on lifetime \\r\\nexpected credit losses are calculated also for an additional category - purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) - \\r\\nregardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of \\r\\nvariable inputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and \\r\\nestimates include: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2;  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 identification of unlikely to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 classification of forbearance and Watch list; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including \\r\\n\\r\\nthe various formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default \\r\\n\\r\\n(LGD) and exposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\uf0b7 determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic \\r\\n\\r\\nand pessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and assigning \\r\\n\\r\\nprobabilities to those scenarios; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe model applied was not changed during the first three quarters of 2020. The macroeconomic parameters were reviewed in \\r\\nthe first and second quarters to reflect the outlook due to COVID-19.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMore qualitative and quantitative information on an impairment of financial assets in light of COVID-19 is provided in Note 3 \\r\\nGeneral Risk Management Policies. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived \\r\\nfrom active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. \\r\\nThe input to these models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement \\r\\nis required in establishing fair values. For the fair value of financial assets and liabilities refer to Note 17. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required \\r\\nin the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements as \\r\\nat 31 December 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe interim financial statements disclose information on changes directly initiated as part of the bank’s response to the COVID-\\r\\n19 pandemic and additional information about changes implemented during the reporting period not directly related to COVID-\\r\\n19 pandemic in further sections of this note.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMAIN GOALS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of risk management at Luminor is to achieve an optimal balance between the risk of losses and the earnings potential in \\r\\na medium- and long-term perspective.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s Risk Management function consists of the Risk Division and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Risk Division is an \\r\\nindependent control and reporting function authorized to verify that Luminor’s business and supporting divisions operate within \\r\\nthe set risk appetite and risk strategy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe ECB-led Comprehensive Assessment (i.e. both the Asset Quality Review and Stress Test exercise) is currently in progress. \\r\\nThe overall exercise is currently planned to end in December 2020, with join-up process in January 2021 and publication of the \\r\\nresults in February 2021.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 30  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo further facilitate the leveraging of synergies between departments, the Risk Division is reorganized as of 1 October 2020. \\r\\nFunctions performed by the Special Projects Department were merged into other departments within the Risk Division. The new \\r\\norganisational chart can be seen below.   \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Enterprise Risk Department is a centralized centre of expertise and manages risk management tools and processes, which \\r\\nrun across different risk types. The control function for credit risk is under the responsibility of the Credit Risk Department. The \\r\\ncontrol function for operational risk lies under the responsibility of the Operational Risk Department. The Market & Liquidity \\r\\nRisk Department is responsible for market risk and liquidity risk control. The Model Risk & Validation Department owns the \\r\\nmodel risk framework and respective validation activities. The Risk Data & Analytics Department combines most of the activities \\r\\nrelated to data and modelling. The first line of defence tasks previously performed by the Market & Liquidity Risk Department \\r\\nwere extracted into the Markets & Treasury Middle Office, which is planned to be moved out of the Risk Division to the first line \\r\\nof defence.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCREDIT RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures imposed by most of the European countries had an adverse impact on the \\r\\neconomies in the first half of 2020. In particular, the social- and economic constraints imposed by the governments across Europe \\r\\nand also in the Baltic states implied a significant reduction of economic activity in the second quarter of 2020, including \\r\\nbusinesses being almost entirely shut down in certain sectors, and increasing unemployment as a consequence. Since Luminor is \\r\\none of the largest banks in the Baltic region, many of Luminor’s customers were directly or indirectly affected by this situation. \\r\\nWhen the restrictions were gradually lifted, signs of improvement have been observed during the third quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nA key governmental support measure was the moratoria agreements introduced by the European Banking Authority (the EBA) \\r\\nand regulated by the EBA Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria on loan repayments applied in the light of the \\r\\nCOVID-19 pandemic (EBA/GL/2020/02). Luminor Bank AS in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania have joined the \\r\\nindustry-wide private moratoria initiatives in each country, which comply with the EBA/GL/2020/02. The moratoria are \\r\\napplicable for performing COVID-19 affected customers experiencing temporarily financial difficulties, yet had acceptable \\r\\npayment discipline during 12 months leading up to the crisis. The terms of postponements are the following:   \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for individual customers, a grace period on principal payments might be granted up to 12 months for mortgage loans and \\r\\nup to 6 months for consumer credits and leasing agreements; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for business customers with an exposure below 5 million EUR, the period of payment postponement is up to 6 months for \\r\\namortising products. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nAny other conditions shall not be changed, and the grace period can be granted only once. The modifications under the moratoria \\r\\nare not classified as forbearance. For the cases not meeting moratoria conditions, an individual solutions are applied and \\r\\nindividual assessment on the exposure classification is performed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe moratoria were in force until 30 September 2020. For the majority of individual customers’ consumer credits and leasing \\r\\nagreements grace periods already ended in July 2020, for the majority of individual customers’ mortgage loans and business \\r\\ncustomers’ loans the end of grace periods is upcoming in October 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has been monitoring the spread of COVID-19 since early 2020 and has adjusted its risk management to the new \\r\\noperating environment. Customers where deterioration of the credit quality was observed or predicted based on the changed \\r\\noperating environment were included into the Watch list in order to monitor them more thoroughly. A Weekly Early Warning \\r\\nIndicator tracker has been established to enable close monitoring of the changes in the portfolio.

During the first three quarters of 2020 the impairment \\r\\nmethodology remained unchanged. \\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent regulatory authorities had announced various measures to deal with the crisis and minimise the effect on the \\r\\neconomies.

The \\r\\ninternal risk grade and probability of default (PD) of banks is based on the available risk classifications from rating agencies \\r\\nMoody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Luminor a separate dedicated Financial Institutions unit acts as a single core competence center and ensures holistic overview \\r\\nof the Group’s credit limits/exposure on banks and countries. Since March 2020, the Financial Institutions Department has \\r\\nswitched from quarterly to daily portfolio monitoring. A Financial Institutions Risk Forum is organised on a regular basis to \\r\\nfollow-up the latest market developments and review if any changes/restrictions are needed for established credit limits towards \\r\\nbanks and countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s portfolio consists of reputable investment grade correspondent banks that have not seen internal credit rating \\r\\ndowngrades during the third quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 36  \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities exposure  (Note 17: except for debt securities - Other financial corporations) of the Group at the end of the third \\r\\nquarter of 2020 was 271 million EUR compared to 211 million EUR at the end of 2019.

The other part consists of level 1 assets (using Liquidity Coverage Ratio terminology), \\r\\nincluding Estonian and Austrian sovereign bonds, and covered bonds issued by French companies. Lithuanian and Estonian \\r\\ncorporate bonds within the trading debt portfolio form the remaining very small part. The average weighted duration of the total \\r\\nportfolio is 4.1 years compared to 3.1 years at the end of 2019. Debt securities investments are performed in accordance with \\r\\nthe limits set by the Luminor’s Management Board and the Supervisory Council.

This includes fostering a sound risk culture in their respective reporting \\r\\nlines to ensure that employees understand the operations that are performed by them, the risks inherent in these, and the \\r\\nimportance of controls they execute or oversee the execution of.   \\r\\n\\r\\nA key objective of the Operational Risk Department is to identify any deviations of Luminor’s operational risk profile from the \\r\\ndesired risk level that is stated in the Risk Appetite Framework, and to do so in a timely manner to ensure any deviations can be \\r\\neffectively managed without significant detriment to the bank, its customers or other stakeholders. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the prevalence and infection rate of COVID-19 fluctuated in the Baltic countries during the third quarter of 2020, Luminor \\r\\nimplemented a system of predefined controls in the form of COVID-19 response states.  These response states allow management \\r\\nto quickly and effectively increase or decrease COVID-19 related restrictions and limitations in response to perceived threat and \\r\\nrisk levels.  The COVID-19 response states are designed as a baseline to manage the risk to Luminor and the bank’s stakeholders, \\r\\nand are country-based.  Should there be a variation between the restrictions in the relevant COVID-19 response state and local \\r\\ngovernmental rules or advice, the more conservative of the two will prevail. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor management is kept updated on the status of operational risk through periodic and ad hoc risk reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nMARKET RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has a low risk appetite for market risk, which is defined as the risk of losses from on- and off-balance sheet positions \\r\\narising from adverse movements in market parameters such as interest rates, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, equity \\r\\nprices or commodity prices. Based on Luminor’s internal risk self-assessment, the most significant parts of the market risk for \\r\\nthe Group are interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange risk, which all stayed well within internal Risk Appetite \\r\\nFramework and lower level limits, while the exposures were at similar levels as they were during the last reporting quarter. The \\r\\nsignificance of other risks is lower, as the Group does not have any open positions in equity instruments for trading, and all \\r\\ncommodity deals with customers are hedged with back-to-back transactions. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the major negative impact to the Group in terms of market risk could arise \\r\\nfrom credit spread risk. This risk is mitigated by limits as well as certain quality requirements for the liquidity bond portfolios. \\r\\nThe Bank follows a rigorous framework for debt securities management. Bond portfolios managed by the Treasury & Asset and \\r\\nLiability Management Department and Markets Department are restricted in terms of size, level of quality, region and \\r\\ncounterparty, limiting credit risk exposure.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bank measures the stressed spread impact to its liquidity bond portfolio as part of the Risk Appetite Framework applying \\r\\nthe severe adverse shock. Assuming a 100 basis points spread widening towards risk-free alternative investments of matching \\r\\nmaturity profile for A-rated bonds and a 50 basis points spread widening for corresponding AA-rated bonds, the projected \\r\\ndecrease in market value of the bonds would be the following: \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR 30 September 2020 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket value loss projection due to increase in credit spreads 9 207 7 850 \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations in time, the risk of incurring losses \\r\\ndue to sudden decrease in financial resources (e.g. a financial crisis situation may result in a delay of incoming payments) or an \\r\\nincrease of the price of new resources for refinancing. The consequence of liquidity risk may be failure to meet obligations to \\r\\nrepay depositors and fulfil loan commitments.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed to ensure a constant ability to settle contractual obligations. The Group has developed a set of early \\r\\nwarning indicators and limits for a timely identification of liquidity crises, and business and funding contingency plans to manage \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 38  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Group’s liquidity during market disruptions. The liquidity risk management strategy is reviewed at least annually or after any \\r\\nsignificant change in the internal or external environment the Group operates in.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed across the three lines of defence: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The first line of defence comprises the Group’s Treasury & Asset and Liability Management (TALM) and the business areas. \\r\\nTALM is responsible for the daily liquidity management and funds transfer pricing (FTP). To ensure the funding in \\r\\nsituations where Luminor is in urgent need of cash and the normal funding sources do not suffice, Luminor holds a liquidity \\r\\nbuffer that consists of Central Bank cash and high quality securities that can be readily sold or used as collateral for funding \\r\\noperations;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Market and Liquidity Risk Department is the second line of defence and is responsible for providing independent oversight \\r\\nand control of liquidity risk and the first line of defence; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The Internal Audit function is the third line of defence, which is responsible for providing independent assurance over the \\r\\nfirst and second lines of defence activities. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLiquidity risk management has a focus on short term obligations and more structural long-term liquidity risk applying different \\r\\ninternal and external metrics. he Group uses a range of liquidity metrics for measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk \\r\\nincluding the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), internal liquidity limits and trigger events, \\r\\nand the survival horizon metric as part of a liquidity stress testing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of intraday and short-term liquidity management is to meet the daily need for funds to ensure compliance with the \\r\\nreserve and liquidity requirements set by the ECB, as well as compliance with internal liquidity limits. Short-term liquidity is \\r\\nmaintained through the daily monitoring of the liquidity status, day-to-day funding and trading the appropriate financial \\r\\ninstruments for liquidity purposes. Long-term liquidity risk management is supported by analysing the estimated future cash \\r\\nflows considering deposit and loan portfolio growth, as well as possible refinancing sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of liquidity risk assessment, the liquidity gap is analysed considering the maturity of cash flows. The liquidity \\r\\nrisk is restricted by imposing internal limits on the liquidity gap. Utilisation of this limit is subject to regular monitoring and \\r\\nreporting to management bodies in the Group. The liquidity gap is calculated by analysing the Group’s net refinancing situation \\r\\nwithin one week, one month and three months applying a \"business as usual\" approach. Liquid assets and short-term liabilities \\r\\nare included in liquidity gap calculations for respective terms (1 week to 3 months). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe LCR is calculated as the ratio of a credit institution’s liquidity buffer to its net liquidity outflows over a 30-calendar-day stress \\r\\nperiod and is expressed as a percentage. The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of the Group’s liquidity risk \\r\\nprofile and requires the holding of risk-free assets that may be easily liquidated to meet required payments for outflows net of \\r\\ninflows during a thirty-day crisis period without support from the central bank. The minimum regulatory limit of LCR is set at \\r\\n100%, however the Group has a substantial buffer over it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe NSFR is defined as the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding over a one-year \\r\\ntime horizon. The minimum requirement for NSFR is 100%, however the Group has a substantial buffer and maintains a higher \\r\\nratio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has set the limits in place for various measures, including LCR, NSFR, liquidity gaps, and manages those within the set \\r\\nlimits by ensuring the proper maturity structure of its assets and liabilities, for example, via issuing long dated debt.

Accounts where the Group held EUR 3.7 billion at the end of \\r\\nSeptember 2020. This buffer can be utilized at any time when the need arises. On top of the Central Bank Accounts, the buffer \\r\\nincludes also the bond portfolio of EUR 276.3 million consisting mainly of government debt securities.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity buffer is supported by the contractual agreement for funding with shareholders DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank \\r\\nAbp. This strongly mitigates the likelihood of funding liquidity risk, which may be caused by deposit run off, wholesale funding \\r\\nrisk (roll over and new issuance), unexpected outflows from off-balance sheet obligations and legal risks (e.g. not being able to \\r\\nissue funding due to legal restrictions). This agreement introduces the requirement for collateral as the facility is collateralized \\r\\nwith assets, primarily with mortgages. Other funding sources requiring collateral are covered bonds and TLTRO. The \\r\\nencumbrance arising from pledged assets is reported and monitored. The collateral is managed by monitoring the fulfillment of \\r\\nthe requirements for each type of collateral. \\r\\n\\r\\nSurvival horizon \\r\\n\\r\\nThe key metric for liquidity risk appetite set in the Risk Appetite Framework is the survival horizon analysed across different \\r\\nstress scenarios. The survival horizon is defined as a period with a positive cumulative cash flow. It is used to capture the liquidity \\r\\nbuffer available outright to be used in liquidity stress situations within 12 months. The outcome of liquidity stress testing is the \\r\\nnumber of days the Group can withstand a liquidity crisis considering Luminor’s mitigating capacity, for example the liquidity \\r\\nbuffer. \\r\\n\\r\\nThree different scenarios are considered while measuring the survival horizon: bank-specific, market-wide and the combination \\r\\nof the most severe assumptions from the previous two. Stress testing assumptions include but are not limited to severe deposit \\r\\nwithdrawals, including early termination of term deposits and run-off of top 5 depositors, deterioration of financial assets, \\r\\ndecrease of loan repayment levels, increase of utilization of credit commitments, as well as limited availability of credit lines from \\r\\nshareholders based on the existing Facility Agreement. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity buffer for the survival horizon metric is strongly affected by the assumption of outgoing deposits in the first few \\r\\ndays and weeks of the turbulence period, with the smaller continuous run-off occurring in the following months. Due to rather \\r\\nhigh concentration of top depositors, the Group tests resistance towards a run-off of the 5 largest depositors as well. Total funds \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 43  \\r\\n\\r\\nof the top 5 largest depositors amounted to 1 884 million EUR at the end of the third quarter of 2020 compared to 1 347 million \\r\\nEUR at the end of 2019. Despite that the Group has sufficient liquidity and can survive for longer than 1 year period without any \\r\\nadditional support. On top of that, Luminor has substantial unused credit line from shareholders which can be utilized at any \\r\\ntime based on the mutual Facility Agreement. Furthermore, the majority of liquid buffer consists of cash held within central banks \\r\\nand highly liquid debt securities which substantially softens the consequences of deteriorating liquidity in case of high outflows.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s liquidity situation is sufficiently strong to survive severe external \\r\\nshocks. \\r\\n\\r\\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s regulatory capital consists fully of Tier 1/Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Tier1/CET1 capital consists of \\r\\nordinary shares, share premium, mandatory reserve, retained earnings of the previous financial year, the audited profit of the \\r\\ncurrent financial year and less the intangible assets, deferred tax assets, revaluation profit of investment properties, current year \\r\\nlosses, if any, and other deductions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital is calculated and allocated for risk coverage following the regulations in the CRD IV and CRR of the EU and the \\r\\napplicable regulatory requirements. The Group’s objectives in capital management are as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 consistency with Luminor Group’s long-term strategy (including meeting the risk appetite of the Group) and the Dividend \\r\\npolicy; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 the ability to pursue the business objectives; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 fulfilment of both internal and external capitalisation targets (capital adequacy); \\r\\n\\uf0b7 sufficient and proper composition of capital that would withstand stressful events. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe capital adequacy assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in accordance with the information guidelines for the risk \\r\\nmanagement and capital adequacy disclosure (Pillar 3) report.  \\r\\n\\r\\nQuantitative information regarding the capital managed by the Group is presented below: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nAccording to the prudential requirements, the Pillar 2 requirement set by the ECB in the 2019 Joint Decision on Capital and the \\r\\nSystemic risk and Countercyclical risk buffer requirements set by the Central Banks of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, Luminor \\r\\nGroup is required to hold capital exceeding 10.1% CET1 and 14.5% Total capital.

The Group does not apply any Value at Risk (VaR) or other internal models for the calculation \\r\\nof the market risk capital requirement and applies the Basic Indicators Approach for calculating the operational risk capital \\r\\nrequirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk-weighted assets are measured by means of risk weights classified according to the nature of each asset and counterparty, \\r\\ntaking into account the collaterals and guarantees eligible for risk mitigation. A similar treatment with some adjustments is \\r\\nadopted for the off-balance sheet exposures. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group reviews and improves the risk identification and management policies and procedures according to changes in the \\r\\nGroup’s activities and financial situation at least once a year. Amendments and updates are mostly done during the annual \\r\\ninternal capital adequacy assessment process when significant risks are to be reassessed or identified and assessed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group complied with all externally imposed capital requirements during the reporting period. \\r\\n\\r\\nGOING CONCERN \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor’s management is fully convinced of a stable and balanced performance going forward and, based on that, prepared \\r\\nthese financial statements on a going concern basis. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 45  \\r\\n\\r\\n4.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where \\r\\nthe fair values of financial assets and liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active \\r\\nmarkets, they are determined in a way that unobservable inputs used to measure fair value would reflect the assumptions that \\r\\nmarket participants would use when pricing assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risk. Where observable \\r\\nmarket data is not available, expert judgment is required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements, \\r\\nthe above mentioned techniques related to unobservable inputs were not used as no such financial assets and liabilities exist on \\r\\nthe statement of financial position of the Group.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTISED COSTS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR  \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value \\r\\n\\r\\n30 September 2020 30 September 2020 31 December 2019 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortised cost         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 3 988 921 3 988 921 2 924 019 2 924 019 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 97 625 97 625 141 645 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 9 626 948 9 302 750 10 222 547 10 324 772 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 13 713 494 13 389 296 13 288 211 13 390 436 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities       \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost       \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n120 152 120 152 980 692 980 692 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 11 070 312 11 070 312 10 235 443 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 1 163 485 1 161 993 651 716 653 967 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 31 146 31 146 45 303 45 303 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 12 385 095 12 383 603 11 913 154 11 915 405 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 53  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarises the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities. Financial \\r\\ninstruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value:  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the \\r\\nmeasurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and shall be used \\r\\nwithout adjustment to measure fair value whenever available; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Level 2 — valuation techniques for which inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 are observable for the \\r\\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must \\r\\nbe observable for a substantial part of the term of the asset or liability; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Level 3 — valuation techniques for which inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be \\r\\nused to measure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations \\r\\nin which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value \\r\\nmeasurement objective remains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market \\r\\nparticipant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs shall reflect the assumptions that \\r\\nmarket participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 54  \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 30 September 2020 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using \\r\\n \\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 3 988 921 0 0 3 988 921 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 97 573 52 0 97 625 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 9 302 750 9 302 750 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial assets 0 0 9 970 9 970 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading     \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 5 272 0 0 5 272 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss     \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 2 523 0 2 523 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities     \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Goverments 246 936 0 0 246 936 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 24 062 0 0 24 062 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial corporations 0 0 13 688 13 688 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments     \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 49 632 686 50 318 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive \\r\\nincome \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 140 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  4 362 764 52 207 9 327 234 13 742 205 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are disclosed     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 88 252 31 900 0 120 152 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 9 598 620 1 471 692 11 070 312 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 498 919 663 074 0 1 161 993 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 31 146 31 146 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value     \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments     \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 47 994 1 359 49 353 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  587 171 10 341 588 1 504 197 12 432 956 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 55  \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 31 December 2019 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using \\r\\n \\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 2 924 019 0 0 2 924 019 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 141 596 49 0 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 10 324 772 10 324 772 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial assets 0  0 29 113 29 113 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value         \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading         \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 3 021 0 0 3 021 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss         \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 4 033 0 4 033 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities         \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Goverments 195 989 0 0 195 989 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 15 023 0 0 15 023 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial corporations 0 0 12 851 12 851 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments         \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 58 087 1 130 59 217 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive \\r\\nincome \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 140 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  3 279 648 62 169 10 368 006 13 709 823 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities         \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are disclosed         \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 29 080 951 612 0 980 692 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 8 074 410 2 161 033 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 653 967 0 653 967 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 45 303 45 303 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value         \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments         \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 56 042 2 262 58 304 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  29 080 9 736 031 2 208 598 11 973 709 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Non-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss (Pension Funds) -

Pension fund units are revalued according to the effective net \\r\\nasset value on the balance sheet date;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Cash and cash balances with central banks – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at \\r\\nthe same price in an orderly transaction;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Due from other credit institutions – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at the same \\r\\nprice in an orderly transaction. Due from other credit institutions are demand deposits;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Loans to customers – fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows with the loan portfolio \\r\\naverage rate which was calculated based on the Bank new sales margin of the third quarter of 2020 and total volume of \\r\\nthe loan portfolio that included  credit risk factors. Same valuation technique is applied to all loan classes and accordingly \\r\\nall loan classes are classified under fair value level 3. As at 31 December 2019 fair value was estimated by discounting \\r\\nestimated future cash flows with the base curve used by the Bank (6m Euribor curve as average for all loans) as adjusted \\r\\nby credit riks factors; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (debt securities) - for domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic \\r\\nstates, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish \\r\\nthe trading offers in the form of prices, yields or equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the \\r\\naverage of bid prices shall be used taking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic \\r\\nstates, or there are no quotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers \\r\\nare clearly incorrect or artificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data using \\r\\nsources like Bloomberg or similar; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the interest \\r\\nrates for items with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured using the assumptions \\r\\nthat market participants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best \\r\\ninterest;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (equities, debt securities):  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source for local equities. These are securities \\r\\nfor which active market exists based on the turnover, meaning availability of quotes at which market \\r\\nparticipants transact in the local stock market. The quotes of foreign equities shall be taken from Bloomberg \\r\\ngiving the priority to the primary market, and then to the country of issuer if the active market exists there. \\r\\nOtherwise, the market with the highest liquidity (turnover) shall be used as a source for pricing. If the quotes \\r\\nin primary data sources are clearly incorrect or artificial, the price of particular equity shall be derived from \\r\\nliquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or similar. Correctness of the quotes described above are the \\r\\nsubject of expert judgment of the Market & Liquidity Risk Department member together with the Bank’s \\r\\nMarkets Department’s dealer responsible for equity trading. For equities of non-listed companies for which \\r\\nactive market does not exist, any available trusted public information on recent trades shall be used for the \\r\\npricing of the equity. Alternatively, dividend discount model shall be used to determine the price of equity. \\r\\nExpert opinion based on other available related market data shall be used for pricing of equity if the previously \\r\\ndescribed methods are not possible;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 For domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be \\r\\nthe priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading offers in the form of prices, yields \\r\\nor equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid prices shall be used \\r\\ntaking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no \\r\\nquotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are \\r\\nclearly incorrect or artificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data \\r\\nusing sources like Bloomberg or similar;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Derivative financial instruments – market data from financial data vendors, electronic trading platforms or third-party \\r\\nvaluation are used for valuation purposes. The derivatives represent non-complex products valued with generally \\r\\naccepted models. Valuation inputs are derived from the market data;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Loans and deposits from credit institutions – the fair value of loans equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the loans from \\r\\ncredit institutions is under market conditions. Expected cash flows of the liabilities from the banks are discounted with \\r\\nthe same market rates as loans. Loans from credit institutions are long-term. Deposits from credit institutions are demand \\r\\ndeposits. The fair value of deposits equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the deposits from credit institutions is under \\r\\nmarket conditions;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 57  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Deposits from customers – the gross carrying amount of demand deposits as a fair value is applied as an approximation \\r\\ndue to very short maturities;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Debt securities issued – Covered bonds are actively traded on market\\u202fusing the market rate yield curve (swap curve) \\r\\nprovided by Bloomberg. The fair value of\\u202fcovered bonds issued by the Bank is calculated\\u202fin a similar way as for actively \\r\\ntraded covered bonds i.e.\\u202fusing spread level based on the existing bond and prevailing market level. The debt securities \\r\\nissued by the Bank are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortized \\r\\ncost using effective interest rate (EIR) method. The fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows using the \\r\\nmarket interest rate yield curve. Covered bonds are classified as Level 1 as they are actively traded on market using the \\r\\nmarket rate yield curve (swaps curve) provided by Bloomberg. \\r\\n\\r\\n18.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by the IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as the Management Board. The \\r\\nManagement Board monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about \\r\\nresource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit before tax and is measured \\r\\nconsistently with profit before tax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of expenses after \\r\\ninternal funds transfer pricing, as management primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a \\r\\nperformance measure. Fees and commission income for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made \\r\\nbetween different product categories for segment reporting.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth \\r\\nManagement. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. \\r\\nCorporate Banking segment services business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager and all leasing customers \\r\\nwho do not have a bank relationship. Retail Banking segment services business customers without a dedicated relationship \\r\\nmanager and private individuals not belonging to Wealth Management segment. Wealth Management services wealthy private \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 59  \\r\\n\\r\\nindividuals and holding companies associated with those individuals. Results of other operating segments are included in Other \\r\\nsegment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments \\r\\n(including internal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Other segment) and income and expenses not \\r\\nbooked on customer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using internally agreed allocation mechanisms. \\r\\nOnly assets and liabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating segments are reported under the respective \\r\\nsegments, all other balance sheet items are not reported under the operating segments to CODM. Loans and Deposits are reported \\r\\nunder operating segments at Gross amounts (and excluding accrued interest). Net impairment (losses/reversal) on loans to \\r\\ncustomers is monitored for each of the segments at Profit or Loss side, while at the Assets side, the CODM only monitors Gross \\r\\namounts of Loans to customers, with impairment allowances not being allocated to operating segments. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first quarter of 2020 it was decided to transfer customers with leasing exposures but without a relationship to bank \\r\\nentities from Other segment to Corporate segment and restatement was made also to historic periods. From the first quarter of \\r\\n2020 Luminor started applying Activity Based Costing to allocate personnel costs, administrative costs and depreciation between \\r\\noperating segments and restatement was also made to segment split of costs to 2019 figures. The asymmetrical allocation of \\r\\nallowance for impairment Net impairment (losses/reversal) on loans to customers, as described above, was applied from the \\r\\nsecond quarter of 2020. Comparative information for Loans and Advances as of 31 December 2019 was changed accordingly. \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Corporate Retail \\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement \\r\\nOther Total

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD \\r\\n\\r\\nJonas Eriksson resigned as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Member of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS effective \\r\\n10 October 2020. The bank announced Eriksson’s decision to resign on 17 August 2020. The Supervisory Council of the bank \\r\\nhas commenced a comprehensive search process for a new CFO. Until a new CFO is appointed, Erkki Raasuke, Chairman of the \\r\\nManagement Board, will oversee responsibility for the bank’s finance function at the Management Board level, supported by \\r\\nOlof Sundblad, Head of Treasury, who will be acting CFO during the interim period. \\r\\n\\r\\nEffective 1 October 2020 the Wealth Management Division was merged with the Retail Banking Division under its current \\r\\nmanagement. Segment reporting will be adjusted for this change in the fourth quarter of 2020 interim report, including \\r\\nrestatement for historic periods. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 62  \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the end of the third quarter and the reporting date, Luminor exited one credit.

As in first half of the year, we looked after the well-being of our \\r\\nstaff and supported our customers. Despite the pandemic we made continued progress with our existing strategy and look \\r\\nforward confidently to growing our business in the period ahead, with a strong balance sheet, increasing efficiency and a unique \\r\\nposition. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs COVID-19 once again effected our home markets, loans to customers fell in the quarter while deposits from customers \\r\\nincreased, leading to a loans-to-deposits ratio of 80% at quarter end. Meanwhile we managed down our portfolio of non-\\r\\nperforming loans. We finished the quarter with non-performing loans equal to 3.2% of gross loans. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe completed the technology carve-out from our former parent banks. Following the migration of Luminor customers to our \\r\\ncommon banking platforms in Latvia and Lithuania earlier in the year, we migrated all our existing Estonian customers to the \\r\\nnew banking platform in Estonia in November. At the beginning of 2021, Luminor and IBM announced a new five-year \\r\\nagreement, under which IBM will support Luminor in accelerating our digital transformation and strengthening further our \\r\\nsecurity and regulatory compliance processes.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOur funding efficiency was improved further by the sale of a 300 million EUR bond and concurrent repurchase of 250 million \\r\\nEUR of an existing security due in 2021. This was an important step to meet our future regulatory requirements, which \\r\\nenhanced our liability structure, and deepened our investor base.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn December, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) issued a guarantee to Luminor to \\r\\nsupport additional lending of at least 660 million to small and medium-sized enterprises and Mid-Caps in the Baltics, and help \\r\\nmitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Luminor is the first bank in the Baltics to agree such a guarantee structure through a synthetic \\r\\nsecuritisation transaction between the bank and the EIB Group with support from the Investment Plan for Europe.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is continuously committed to preventing and detecting money laundering and financial crime. In the fourth quarter, \\r\\nLuminor continued to invest in our human and technological capabilities, and to review our systems and processes, so we can \\r\\nadapt in a constantly changing environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic economies have proven very resilient through the pandemic and are well equipped to face future challenges. Luminor \\r\\nwill continue to be a trusted banking partner for individuals and businesses throughout the Baltics. I look forward to leading \\r\\nLuminor as we begin the next phase of our strategy. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPeter Bosek \\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 4  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral information \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor) was established on 1 October 2017 through the merger of the Baltic operations of DNB Bank ASA \\r\\n(Commercial Register no. 984 851 006, DNB) and Nordea Bank Abp (Commercial Register no. 2858394-9, Nordea) to create a \\r\\nnew-generation financial service provider for local businesses and financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 it was announced that the transaction signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB, Nordea and US-\\r\\nbased private equity firm Blackstone had been concluded and as a result a consortium led by private equity funds managed by \\r\\nBlackstone acquired a 60.1% majority stake in the bank. The bank’s initial owners Nordea and DNB each retained a 19.95% \\r\\nequity stake in Luminor, but an arrangement has been made by the consortium and Nordea for the purchase of Nordea’s \\r\\nremaining stake over the coming years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with some 900 000 clients, 2 378 employees, and market \\r\\nshare of 16.1% in deposits and 17.2% in lending as at the end of December 2020. Luminor has total shareholders’ equity of 1.7 \\r\\nbillion EUR and it is capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 22.4%. Luminor’s core business is serving entrepreneurial people in the \\r\\nBaltics with a primary focus on local companies and the financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers its customers a wide range of products and services through all possible channels, digital and physical, with 29 \\r\\ncustomer service centres in total in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, of which seven are meet-up points. Luminor owns 363 ATMs \\r\\nthroughout the Baltic states, and additionally provides services through 100 ATMs in partnership with other financial services \\r\\nproviders.  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Estonia Latvia Lithuania Total  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of customers ~128 000 ~218 000 ~544 000 ~891 000 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket shares      \\r\\n\\r\\nLending 11.7% 22.1% 19.7% 17.2% \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits 8.6% 16.0% 21.7% 16.1% \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of client service \\r\\ncentres, including meet- \\r\\nup points \\r\\n\\r\\n8 9 12 29  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of employees 594 823 961 2 378 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview \\r\\n\\r\\nThe effects of COVID-19 dominated the economies of the Baltic countries in 2020. The notable rebound, from the impact of the \\r\\ninitial lockdown, observed in the third quarter was led by consumers, but exports and investments also staged a significant \\r\\ncomeback. The retail trade continued to be strong into year-end, reflecting the resilience of consumers.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is still a long way to go before a broad-based recovery is achieved, with the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak \\r\\nbringing along new lockdowns across the Baltics These renewed lockdowns are expected to result in another decline in activity \\r\\nin the fourth quarter. However, the setbacks to the region and have been more limited as compared to the full lockdown and \\r\\nthe global contraction in trade in the spring.   \\r\\n\\r\\nIndustrial production has recovered partially. December marked the sixth consecutive month of expansion for euro area \\r\\nmanufacturing despite the headwinds from the virus. Production volumes in the Baltic economies were close to their pre-crisis \\r\\nlevels. Industrial production was up in October by 1% over the year in Estonia and 1.6% in Lithuania, and down by 1.1% in \\r\\nLatvia. In contrast production volumes in the euro area were down 3.8%. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is pent-up demand in the Baltic area, where savings grew strongly. Despite the near-term setback from the resurgence of \\r\\nthe coronavirus, the development of vaccines has given greater confidence to the assumption that the health crisis will be \\r\\nresolved gradually throughout 2021 and into 2022, which in turn will enable economies to return to normal.    \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 5  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe impact of COVID-19 on Luminor \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter we continued to apply all measures needed to look after the safety and well-being of our staff and \\r\\ncustomers in the face of COVID-19. These include encouraging remote working, paying extra attention to cleaning and the \\r\\nincreasing the availability of disinfectants in our premises, and providing protective equipment to our customer-facing \\r\\nemployees.    \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also continued our efforts to promote remote services. We introduced a system of pre-booked visits in our customer service \\r\\ncentres to minimise physical contacts and so safeguard against the pandemic. Employees are informed regularly about \\r\\nprevailing guidelines, restrictions, and recommendations to keep themselves and their customers safe and prevent the spread \\r\\nof the virus. \\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the pandemic Luminor has supported its customers when needed. Further details of this support can be found in \\r\\n‘Asset Quality for Q4 2020’, below, and Note 3 to the Financial Statements, ‘General Risk management Policies’. \\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness development \\r\\n\\r\\nThe transformation of Luminor continued successfully in the fourth quarter. The main efforts were directed towards finalising \\r\\nthe technology carve-out from parent banks.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new banking platform in Estonia was launched in October, after which all the existing customers, over 100 000 in total, \\r\\nwere migrated over the last weekend in November. The legacy platform was shut down in December and the carve-out in \\r\\nEstonia was completed by the end of the year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe successful carve-out in Estonia was the last of Luminor’s customer migrations in the Baltics. Since the end of November \\r\\n2020, we have been operating technology platforms that are fully independent of the systems of either DNB or Nordea.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEntering 2021, Luminor is ready for the next stage of the transformation. We will strengthen our focus on further improving \\r\\ncustomer satisfaction and accelerating our digital development and growth.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we continued to improve our remote customer onboarding capabilities and to scale our marketing \\r\\nactivities targeted at new customer acquisition. The lockdowns and restrictions imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic \\r\\nfurther boosted customer preference for remote digital onboarding. As the result, the share of remotely onboarded customers \\r\\ngrew to 40%, and we expect the upward trend to continue into 2021. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also continued scaling our sales of the new products and services that we had launched earlier in the year. In the fourth \\r\\nquarter of 2020, we doubled the number of new Black Credit Cards issued to customers, and we tripled the turnover of \\r\\ntransactions through the Luminor E-Commerce Gateway. Assets under management in the Luminor Investor platform \\r\\nincreased by 40% over the quarter, and we have strengthened the platform with new features, giving it fully digital onboarding, \\r\\ninstant cash transfers and a simpler sign-in process.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe brand new internet bank and digital channels were launched in the fourth quarter for Luminor customers in Estonia, and \\r\\nthey are designed to be more user-friendly and give an intuitive experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe volume of deposits in the Retail Banking segment increased by 387 million EUR in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was \\r\\nsignificantly more than the growth of 259 million EUR in the same period last year. \\r\\n\\r\\nMajor efforts were made in the fourth quarter by the Retail Banking team to support the migration of 100 000 customers to the \\r\\nnew channels in Estonia at the end of the year. Several changes were introduced to ensure support and availability for our \\r\\ncustomers, and they included expanding the Call Centre team during the migration period, doing extensive communications \\r\\nwork, and introducing the Change Ambassadors initiative.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe overall focus of Retail Banking in the fourth quarter remained centred on mortgage loans, consumer loans and new \\r\\ncustomer acquisition.   \\r\\n\\r\\nCustomer interest in mortgage lending in the fourth quarter was even greater than before the pandemic. The total volume of \\r\\ntransactions in the real estate market for private individuals was the largest in recent years despite the impact of COVID-19 in \\r\\nall three Baltic markets. More and more clients preferred Luminor as their financial adviser and partner for a mortgage, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 6  \\r\\n\\r\\nresulting in 55% growth in mortgages in the fourth quarter from the third. We have adapted to changing customer needs by \\r\\ncontinuously improving our advisory process, risk evaluation and offers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe demand for consumer loans was squeezed strongly by the COVID-19 restrictions on shopping, travel and other areas of \\r\\nspending. The result was that new sales volumes were 1.52 million EUR smaller in the fourth quarter than in the previous \\r\\nquarter. There were also more applicants whose income had been affected by the pandemic, and the bank advised such \\r\\ncustomers to wait for the situation to stabilise. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team also continued to consolidate its distribution channels during the fourth quarter and improve \\r\\nefficiency in related areas. At the end of the fourth quarter, Luminor was serving its customers in a total of 29 locations across \\r\\nthe Baltics, of which seven are meet-up points.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPension assets grew to 1.6 billion EUR, which was 10.1% more than a year earlier and 7.4% more than in the third quarter. By \\r\\nthe end of the year, Luminor had some 284 000 second pillar pension customers and 63 700 third pillar pension customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth quarter of 2020 was the turning point when the focus of the Private Banking segment switched from savings towards \\r\\ngrowing investment volumes in an environment of low margins. Investment assets were up 17% on the same quarter of 2019. \\r\\nThe Luminor Investor platform is a preferred solution that is gaining increasing interest from customers of Private Banking. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe corporate banking lending book contracted in the fourth quarter by 208 million EUR.  This was primarily because of the \\r\\nseasonal amortisation of the overdrafts of agricultural wholesalers and a decrease in the non-performing portfolio. The \\r\\ninvestment lending portfolio was stable.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit volumes increased by a further 344 million EUR on the back of large increases in public sector deposits even though \\r\\nnegative rates were introduced for major accounts. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn December, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) issued a guarantee to Luminor to \\r\\nsupport additional lending to small and medium-sized enterprises and Mid-Caps in the Baltics and help mitigate the impacts of \\r\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The guarantee structure can support at least 660 million EUR of additional loans and leases to SMEs \\r\\nand Mid-Caps in all three Baltic countries through a synthetic securitisation transaction between the bank and the EIB Group \\r\\nwith a support from the Investment Plan for Europe. Luminor is the first bank in the Baltics to use such facility. \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe safety and well-being of Luminor employees and customers continued to be the top priority in the fourth quarter of 2020 \\r\\nin all the bank’s activities, as comprehensive measures were continuously applied to ensure the safety of both employees and \\r\\ncustomers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nContinuous work was done to address issues of Environmental Social Governance (ESG) in a comprehensive way. A separate \\r\\nESG strategy was written in the fourth quarter for 2021-2023, outlining the Luminor stance towards ESG and detailing the \\r\\nproposed strategy, including a roadmap for organisational and programme governance. The strategy covers the \\r\\nrecommendations that are generally recognised in addressing topics of ESG, particularly climate change and the environment, \\r\\nbusiness strategy and models, a risk management framework, governance, and disclosures and reporting.  \\r\\n\\r\\nA new Head of Investor Relations and Sustainable Finance joined Luminor’s Treasury team from October. An inter-divisional \\r\\npermanent ESG working group was set up as well, to ensure that there is sufficient focus and coordination on environmental \\r\\nand social topics in all the divisions of the organisation. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo enhance work-life balance and to further the focus on employee well-being, a Work Environment and Wellbeing Unit was \\r\\nestablished in the structure of the People & Culture division in the fourth quarter. A company-wide approach was taken where \\r\\nemployees were strongly encouraged and enabled to use their vacation time during the holidays at the end of the year. \\r\\n\\r\\nContinued efforts were made to promote financial literacy and cyber security to the public, including raising awareness about \\r\\nsafe online shopping and how to guard against fraudsters. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo support regional business, the best local entrepreneurs were given recognition with the Luminor Development Leap Award \\r\\nin Estonia, which gave the winner the opportunity for a consultation with Luminor’s top managers in the field of their choice. \\r\\nContinuous support was given to local business in Latvia by providing and promoting an online platform for local crafts workers, \\r\\nartisans and small businesses. \\r\\n\\r\\nA Luminor scholarship was granted to an Estonian student for doctoral studies at the University of Cambridge to research the \\r\\nearly signs of Alzheimer’s disease.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 7  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn December, Luminor made a donation to give Christmas gifts to the community. The Christmas donation was used to buy \\r\\ncomputers for families with many children to support distance learning in Estonia, to support the victims of violence in Latvia, \\r\\nand to support a volunteer youth line providing emotional aid in Lithuania. \\r\\n\\r\\nEFFORTS TO PREVENT FINANCIAL CRIME  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor remains vigilant about financial crime and is committed to preventing and detecting it. We continue to review our anti-\\r\\nfinancial crime (AFC) practices regularly and invest in the human and technological resources that are needed. We work \\r\\nconstantly to get a better understanding of our customers and their transactions, and to manage and report any potential \\r\\nfinancial crime risk. Luminor predominantly serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers who have a strong \\r\\npersonal or business connection to the Baltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, Luminor continued to apply its financial crime risk management framework in order to \\r\\nprevent, detect, manage and report potential financial crime, and this was supported by its conservative approach towards \\r\\nmoney laundering and financial crime. The framework covers the technology, policies and procedures employed to detect \\r\\nfinancial crime, assess risks, run training and awareness-raising, and monitor new and developing financial crime risks \\r\\ncontinuously.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is subject to a wide range of legal requirements, and so we are transparent in all our activities and we work closely \\r\\nwith all the supervisory and regulatory authorities. Luminor also follows the international guidelines, recommendations and \\r\\nstandards issued by the regulatory and supervisory authorities, international bodies, local banking associations, and financial \\r\\nintelligence units in each Baltic state.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to invest in systems and processes so we can adapt in a constantly changing environment. The bank is \\r\\nfurther developing its common monitoring and screening solution in all three Baltic states and has approved several further \\r\\ndevelopments that will be delivered during 2021. The developments are directed to further enhancements of monitoring \\r\\nactivities. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor considers that work to raise awareness is an important component of the financial crime risk management framework. \\r\\nIn the fourth quarter, 9 training events related to AFC and corporate compliance areas were held.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is also contributing to general AML efforts by participating in a pilot programme AML Bridge which has been launched \\r\\njointly with an AML start-up, the largest banks in Estonia, and related state authorities.  The aim of this pilot is to promote \\r\\ncollaborative crime-fighting in the banking industry and enhance the efficient use of data in AML efforts. The results of the pilot \\r\\nwill be announced in spring 2021. In Lithuania, Luminor is participating in the establishment of AML Competences Centre. The \\r\\nnew establishment will enhance cooperation between financial institutions and authorities, will improve information sharing \\r\\namong private and public sector, and will be an additional tool for Luminor in the fight against financial crime. \\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER EVENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nEffective 1 October 2020 the Wealth Management Division was merged with the Retail Banking Division under its current \\r\\nmanagement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nJonas Eriksson resigned as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Member of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS effective \\r\\n10 October 2020. The bank announced Eriksson’s decision to resign on 17 August 2020. The Supervisory Council of the bank \\r\\nhas commenced a comprehensive search process for a new CFO. Until a new CFO is appointed, Peter Bosek, Chairman of the \\r\\nManagement Board, will oversee responsibility for the bank’s finance function at the Management Board level, supported by \\r\\nOlof Sundblad, Head of Treasury, who will be acting CFO during the interim period. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetsy Nelson joined the Supervisory Council of Luminor Bank AS, effective from 1 December 2020.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn December, Luminor sold a 300 million EUR bond issue. In addition, it repurchased 250 million EUR of an existing bond that \\r\\nmature in 2021. The bond, which is rated Baa2 by Moody’s, is listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and was issued under Luminor’s \\r\\nEMTN programme. \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 31 DECEMBER \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 January 2021, Peter Bosek became Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS.   \\r\\n\\r\\nMarilin Pikaro announced her decision to resign as Head of the Compliance Division and Member of the Management Board of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS effective from 5 January 2021. Mari Mõis, Head of the Legal Division, was appointed to take over the position \\r\\nof Chief Compliance Officer from 6 January 2021.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 8  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 January 2021, Luminor Bank and IBM announced a new five-year agreement. Under the agreement Luminor will migrate \\r\\nits IT infrastructure to IBM Cloud for Financial Services. IBM will support Luminor in accelerating its digital transformation and \\r\\nstrengthening further its security and regulatory compliance processes. As part of the agreement, some 200 people from \\r\\nLuminor’s Technology Division will be transferred to IBM. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 March 2021, Luminor Operations Department will be incorporated with the Technology Division.  \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 9  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit in the fourth quarter was 18.6 million EUR, 14.6 million EUR more than in the same quarter of last year. A reduction \\r\\nin net operating income of 12.1 million EUR was more than offset by a 2.9 million EUR reduction in total operating expenses \\r\\nand a net reversal of impairments of 14.2 million EUR as compared to impairments of 11.8 million EUR in the fourth quarter of \\r\\n2019.   \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating income in the fourth quarter was 82.6 million EUR. Net interest income decreased marginally to 57.1 million \\r\\nEUR, with a 5.5 million EUR reduction in interest income being largely balanced by a 5.2 million EUR reduction in interest \\r\\nexpense. Net fee and commission income increased by 2.0 million EUR. A number of one off items, such as recognition of the \\r\\nvalue of shares in VISA, part of the profit from the sale of the headquarters building in Riga and higher gains from trading due \\r\\nto higher USD Libor rates, were included in net other operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019. If these items are excluded \\r\\nfrom the comparison, net other operating income remained at a similar level in the fourth quarter of 2020 as in the fourth \\r\\nquarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses were 75.5 million EUR. Personnel expenses were 4.0 million EUR higher in the fourth quarter of 2020, \\r\\nas prior year reversals were replaced by additional charges. In contrast, Other administrative expenses reduced by 6.9 million \\r\\nEUR.   Exceptional costs, incurred to transform Luminor, were 27.8 million EUR, an increase of 2.1 million EUR compared to the \\r\\nsame period of last year as Luminor continued to invest in regulatory compliance implementation and business re-design.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost-to-income ratio for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 91.4% having been 82.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding \\r\\nexceptional costs, the respective ratios were 57.8% and 55.7%. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor recorded a 14.2 million EUR net reversal of impairments in the quarter. The most important contributor to this result \\r\\nwas an exit from a major non-performing exposure because of which the previously recognised loan loss decreased by 9.0 \\r\\nmillion EUR. In addition, collective provisions decreased due to reduction of portfolio, while there were no new significant loss \\r\\ncases in the quarter. Non-performing loans shrank to 3.2% of the loan portfolio by end of the quarter, lower than the 3.8% as \\r\\nof end of 2019.  Tax expense increased from near zero in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 2.2 million EUR in the fourth quarter this \\r\\nyear, as profit before tax increased and the jurisdiction where profit was generated changed. Profit after tax was 18.6 million \\r\\nEUR which was retained and added to equity. \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity for the fourth quarter was 4.5% in 2020 and 1.0% in 2019. Excluding exceptional costs, the respective ratios \\r\\nwere 10.1% and 6.3%. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal assets rose by 729 million EUR during the quarter. Customer deposits increased by 713 million EUR to 11.8 billion EUR \\r\\nwhile loans to customers decreased by 196 million EUR to 9.4 billion EUR.

Growth has been led by deposits in Lithuania, particularly public sector \\r\\ndeposits, which grew by 66% and individual customer deposits, which grew by 11%. During fourth quarter growth has been \\r\\ndriven by individual and business customers. Luminor’s share of the deposit market in the Baltics fell from 16.6% to 16.1% \\r\\nover the 12 months. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 12  \\r\\n\\r\\nASSET QUALITY FOR Q4 2020   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe quality of the loan portfolio continued to improve. The negative consequences of COVID-19 have been limited to date and \\r\\nhave mostly impacted certain industries and customers, while others have so far almost not been affected.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most severe impact was felt by industries like accommodation and food service activities, tourism, and aviation. Luminor’s \\r\\nexposure towards these sectors is small at 0.7% of the total net lending to customers. A little under a third of the net exposure \\r\\nwithin these affected sectors is classified as Stage 3.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have supported our customers through the pandemic in particular through loan modifications. The most common \\r\\nmodification requested were grace periods for principal payments. Grace periods for principal and interest payments were \\r\\ngranted only under exceptional circumstances, and only for around 1% of all modifications.  The outstanding balance of loans \\r\\nunder modifications decreased from 593 million to 77 million EUR over the fourth quarter. The total amount of modification \\r\\nrequests for mortgage loans reached 22 million EUR during the fourth quarter, which is 5 million EUR more than in the third \\r\\nquarter, but much less than in the second quarter, where modification requests totalled 315 million EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe level of exposures overdue by more than 5 days in the portfolio with modifications after the end of the grace period is \\r\\nslightly higher, by 1 percentage point, than it is in the portfolio without modifications (4.1% vs 3.1%). The level of exposures \\r\\noverdue more than 30 days is the same for the portfolio with modifications after the end of the grace period compared to the \\r\\nportfolio without modifications. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aggregated volume of requests for modifications including grace periods stood at 1.1 billion EUR at the end of the fourth \\r\\nquarter and covered 12% of the total credit portfolio, which is almost the same as at the end of the third quarter. The total value \\r\\nof modifications approved reached almost 1.0 billion EUR at the end of the fourth quarter. From the above mentioned received \\r\\nand approved modification requests grace periods have already expired (are back on normal repayment schedules) for around \\r\\n90% of the modified exposures, and this has not led to any noticeable changes in overdue loans within these exposures that \\r\\nwere under modification measures. The inflow of modification requests has almost stopped already in the third quarter, the \\r\\nonly exception are mortgage loans, where modification requests have somewhat resumed during December 2020, but at much \\r\\nlower levels than during the first lockdown.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s loan loss provisioning resulted in reversals of 14.2 million EUR during the fourth quarter. The increase in individual \\r\\nprovisions for some few larger COVID-19 related exposures and problematic real estate exposure was significantly lower than \\r\\nthe positive effect from the resolution of other legacy non-performing exposures and a reduction in Stage 2 provisions driven \\r\\nby risk profile improvements (such as rating upgrades and exclusion from the Watch-list) and exposure decrease. More \\r\\ninformation is provided in Note 2 Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgments).  \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-performing loans totalled 305.4 million EUR. The share of non-performing loans (NPL ratio) was 3.2% at the end of the \\r\\nfourth quarter, which is 0.5 percentage points lower than in the previous quarter. Even though the COVID-19 driven inflow \\r\\ncontinued in the fourth quarter, the outflow was more than three times the inflow, and this left the volume of non-performing \\r\\nloans at its historically lowest level ever in Luminor. The targets defined in Luminor’s non-performing loans’ strategy have been \\r\\nfulfilled – over a 3 year period, non-performing loans were decreased by more than 500 million EUR. The key drivers for the \\r\\ndecrease in the non-performing portfolio were collection activities including sales of collaterals, sales of claim rights, and write-\\r\\noffs of the amounts remaining after collection activities. The NPL ratio for the mortgage loan portfolio was 2.7%, which \\r\\nrepresents an increase of 0.1 percentage points.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal allowances for expected credit losses on the balance sheet were 136.9 million EUR at the end of the quarter, of which 92.3 \\r\\nmillion EUR were for Stage 3 exposures.    \\r\\n\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report

Luminor has managed to replace the funding from its former parent banks by reducing \\r\\nlending volumes and by improving the funding structure.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit volumes continued to increase during the fourth quarter of 2020. Deposits from customers stood at 11 784 million EUR \\r\\nat the end of the fourth quarter, and at 11 070 million EUR at the end of the third quarter. In addition, the total value of the \\r\\nbonds outstanding under the Euro Medium Term Note or EMTN programme was 1 201 million EUR, with 699 million EUR of \\r\\nsenior unsecured bonds and a five-year 502 million EUR covered bond. Luminor issued a long three-year 300 million EUR senior \\r\\nunsecured bond and tendered 250.7 million EUR (nominal amount) of senior unsecured bonds issued in October 2018. The \\r\\nissuance was well received in the market with a substantial order book from investors from 22 different countries. In November \\r\\n2020 Luminor further increased the issuance capacity of its covered bonds programme by adding a portfolio of Lithuanian \\r\\nmortgage loans to the cover pool. After taking in the Lithuanian assets, the cover pool consists of housing loans from all three \\r\\nBaltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a committed funding facility agreement with its former parent banks, DNB and Nordea, that is provided in the \\r\\nform of a syndicate, with each partner in the syndicate supplying 50% of the funding. At the end of the fourth quarter the total \\r\\nfacility stood at 300 million EUR and was fully undrawn. The total commitment was reduced by 737 million EUR during the \\r\\nfourth quarter following a voluntary cancellation by Luminor. The amount of the facility has been committed for five years from \\r\\n1 October 2019, with an initial commitment for three years and the option for Luminor to extend it by up to two years, and it \\r\\ncan be drawn with maturities of one, two or three years. The facility is partly secured, as Luminor had assigned mortgage loans \\r\\nto it with a carrying value of 294.2 million EUR at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 18  \\r\\n\\r\\nStructure of Liabilities and Equity: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 April 2020 Luminor received its minimum own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) requirement in a decision of the Single \\r\\nResolution Board (the SRB) dated 20 December 2019 that was executed for Luminor by a decision of the Estonian Financial \\r\\nSupervision and Resolution Authority. The MREL decision sets the following MREL requirements for Luminor: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Holding AS (the parent company of Luminor Bank AS) shall comply with the MREL at the consolidated level of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS of 17.28% of total liabilities and own funds at all times, and 11.97% of total liabilities and own funds \\r\\nshall be met with subordinated instruments; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Holding AS shall have a transitional period until 30 June 2022 to comply with these requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 the total MREL ratio stood at 14.9% at the consolidated level of Luminor Bank AS, \\r\\ndown from 15.9% at the end of the third quarter, while 10.8% of total liabilities and own funds were subordinated instruments \\r\\nas at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, down from 11.3% at the end of the third quarter of 2020. It should be noted that the \\r\\nMREL requirements (set versus Total Liabilities and Own Funds) were set using data as of 31 March 2019, which means the \\r\\ndecision (and thus the MREL requirement) does not consider any subsequent events impacting the capital requirements and thus \\r\\nalso the MREL requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of \\r\\nBaa1/Prime-2, with a stable outlook. There have been no changes to Luminor’s ratings since then. On 25 September 2020 \\r\\nMoody’s issued an updated credit opinion for Luminor.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 March 2020 Moody’s assigned a definitive Aa1 rating to the mortgage covered bonds issued by Luminor Bank AS under \\r\\nthe Estonian Covered Bonds Act. \\r\\n\\r\\n  LIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s structural liquidity risk is conservative and well-balanced. It is based on metrics that measure liquidity risk and is \\r\\nappropriately adapted to the current economic and regulatory environment. Luminor uses a range of metrics to measure \\r\\nliquidity risk, one of which is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The LCR for Luminor was 195% at the end of the fourth quarter \\r\\nof 2020 and 177% at the end of the third quarter under the definition of the LCR given in the Capital Requirements Regulation \\r\\n(CRR). The ratio continued to increase as the increase in deposits supported the liquidity position of the bank. The liquidity \\r\\nbuffer is composed of highly liquid central-bank-eligible securities and cash. Long-term liquidity risk is measured with the Net \\r\\nStable Funding Ratio (NSFR). Luminor’s NSFR rose to 159% during the fourth quarter of 2020 from 144% at the end of the third \\r\\nquarter. The improvement was driven by the increased deposit base benefiting the Available Stable Funding (AFS) and by the \\r\\ndecrease in the amount of Required Stable Funding (RSF). The RSF was impacted mainly by a reduction of the funding facility \\r\\ncommitment that lowered the amount of encumbered assets. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n274\\r\\n\\r\\n4 618 4 471\\r\\n\\r\\n2 694\\r\\n\\r\\n1201\\r\\n1665\\r\\n\\r\\nAll other Liabilit ies Corporate deposits Retail deposits Public sector\\r\\n\\r\\ndeposits\\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securit ies issued Equity\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 19  \\r\\n\\r\\n Q4 2020 Q3  2020 Q2  2020 Q1 2020 Q4  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 194.7% 177.2% 159.0% 143.7% 149.8% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR 159.0% 143.6% 133.2% 126.0% 123.0% \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are predominantly from residents of the Baltics.

The Risk Exposure Amount \\r\\n(REA) fell to 7 086 million EUR, from 7 969 million EUR on 31 December 2019, mainly because the loan portfolio shrank. As at \\r\\nthe end of the fourth quarter of 2020, Luminor had 1 586 million EUR in own funds and they were fully composed of Common \\r\\nEquity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, meaning the Tier 1 and total capital ratios of Luminor stood at the same level as the CET1 ratio.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with the CRR, fell to 10.2% at the end of the fourth quarter from 10.7% at the end \\r\\nof the third quarter. The fall was driven primarily by the increase in central bank assets that raised the leverage ratio exposure. \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital ratios  \\r\\n\\r\\nPosition Q4  2020 Q3  2020 Q2  2020 Q1 2020 Q4  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeverage ratio 10.16% 10.71% 11.23% 11.46% 10.88% \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio 22.39% 21.99% 22.04% 20.54% 19.66% \\r\\n\\r\\nT1 capital ratio 22.39% 21.99% 22.04% 20.54% 19.66% \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal capital ratio 22.39% 21.99% 22.04% 20.54% 19.66% \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe prudential requirements, which are the Pillar 2 requirement set by the European Central Bank (the ECB) in the 2019 Joint \\r\\nDecision on Capital, and the Systemic Risk Buffer and Countercyclical Risk Buffer requirements set by the Latvian, Estonian and \\r\\nLithuanian supervisory authorities, obliged Luminor to hold capital exceeding 10.1% of CET1 and 14.5% of Total Capital as at \\r\\n30 September 2020.

The bonus share \\r\\nissue is based on the bank’s interim balance sheet as at 2 January 2019 and involves a partial conversion of share premium in the amount of \\r\\n216 030 920 EUR into share capital. Following the bonus issue, the share capital of the bank has been reduced by the same amount and was \\r\\npaid out to the shareholders in September 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 26  \\r\\n\\r\\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Notes \\r\\n1 January 2020 to  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2020 \\r\\n1 January 2019 to  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flows from operating activities       \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit before tax   35 767 59 262 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustment for:     \\r\\n\\r\\n-Net impairment (-)/ reversal (+) on loans to customers, excluding off-balance sheet \\r\\ncommitments \\r\\n\\r\\n3 14 510 24 015 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Net impairment (-)/ reversal (+) on off-balance sheet commitments  3 130 -1 038 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Dividend income   -64 -90 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Share of profit from an associate   -392 -1 046 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Loss (+) / profit (-) from foreign currency revaluation   -3 052 -428 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Depreciation, amortisation and impairment   12 096 13 177 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Profit from sale of subsidiaries and associates  0 -8 962 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Other adjustments   535 2 396 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Interest income  4 -273 762 -301 677 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Interest expenses  4 46 832 47 525 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from operations before changes in operating assets/liabilities   -164 400 -166 866 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in operating assets/liabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of lending to customers   763 812 1 260 019 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of other assets   -54 642 -57 529 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (+) / decrease (-) of client deposits 12, 13  1 563 227 -1 796 273 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of liabilities   -35 785 47 313 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest received   285 105 314 015 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest paid   -54 835 -51 790 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncome tax paid   -13 078 -11 507 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from operating activities   2 453 804 -295 752 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nInvesting activities     \\r\\n\\r\\nAcquisition of property, equipment and intangible assets   -2 974 -9 385 \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from disposal of property, equipment and intangible assets  3 545 5 160 \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from disposals of investment property  1 492 30 138 \\r\\n\\r\\nDividend received   796 1 754 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from investing activities   2 859 27 667 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancing activities     \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 14  802 750 298 809 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 27  \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities buy back  -254 912 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayment of principal of parent funding \\r\\n                          \\r\\n\\r\\n12 \\r\\n-1 155 000 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from parent funding 12 250 000 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments of principal on leases   -6 162 -5 957 \\r\\n\\r\\nPay-out to the Shareholder  0 -216 031 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flows from financing activities   -363 324 76 821 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nNet increase (+) / decrease (-) in cash and cash equivalents   1 928 939 -358 130 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period  8,9 2 952 815 3 310 517 \\r\\n\\r\\nEffects of currency translation on cash and cash equivalents   3 052 428 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet increase (+) / decrease (-) in cash and cash equivalents   1 928 939 -358 130 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period   4 884 806 2 952 815 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents comprise     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash on hand  8 123 809 140 518 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-restricted current account with central bank  8 4 690 457 2 670 701 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions on demand or with original maturity of three \\r\\nmonths or less \\r\\n\\r\\n 9 70 540 141 596 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   4 884 806 2 952 815 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 28  \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL \\r\\nSTATEMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\n1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE INFORMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) is a local credit institution whose parent company is Luminor Holding AS \\r\\nthat is ultimately controlled by BCP VII, an investment fund managed by an affiliate of Blackstone Group Inc. Other shareholders \\r\\nof Luminor Holding AS - Nordea Bank Abp and DNB BANK ASA - are considered to be the entities with significant influence over \\r\\nthe Group. The Luminor Bank’s registered legal address is Liivalaia 45, 10145, Tallinn, Republic of Estonia. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Holding AS, established on 14 May 2019, is the parent company of Luminor Bank AS since 23 September 2019. Until 23 \\r\\nSeptember 2019 the parent company was Luminor Group AB. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor Bank AS has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries \\r\\nthrough the Estonian registered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone acquired a 60.1% majority stake in the \\r\\nLuminor Holding AS, the owner of Luminor Bank AS. Luminor Bank AS previous owners, Nordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB \\r\\nBANK ASA (\"DNB\"), each retained a 19.95% equity stake in the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current interim report, “Bank” (or Luminor Bank AS) refers to Luminor Bank AS. “Group” refers to the consolidated \\r\\nfinancial statements of Luminor Bank AS and its subsidiaries.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 December 2020 Luminor Bank AS directly or indirectly owned majority in the following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country Republic of \\r\\nEstonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country Republic of Latvia: Registered country Republic of \\r\\nLithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Liising AS  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Pensions Estonia AS \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Promano Estonia OÜ (under \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation)   \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Asset Management IPAS \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Finance SIA (under liquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Līzings SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Realm SIA (under liquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 2 SIA (under liquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 3 SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 4 SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 6 SIA (under liquidation)  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Trioleta SIA (under liquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Baltic ipasums SIA (under liquidation) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Investiciju Valdymas \\r\\nUAB \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Lizingas UAB \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Industrius UAB (under \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Intractus UAB \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Promano Lit UAB (under \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Recurso UAB (under \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation) \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 December 2020 Luminor Bank AS had ownership in the following associated companies: \\r\\n\\uf0b7 ALD Automotive AS (25%)  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 ALD Automotive SIA (25%) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 ALD Automotive UAB (25%) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 SIA Kredītinformācijas Birojs (22,61%) \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) was prepared \\r\\nin accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU. The condensed consolidated interim financial \\r\\ninformation does not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read \\r\\nin conjunction with the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 29  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are consistent \\r\\nwith those followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, \\r\\nexcept for the adoption of new standards effective as of 1 January 2020. The Group has not early adopted any standard, \\r\\ninterpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. Several amendments and interpretations apply for the \\r\\nfirst time in 2020, but do not have a material impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS Interpretation Committee agenda decision regarding deferred tax related to investments in subsidiaries \\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Estonia and Latvia have replaced the traditional profit-based tax regimes with distribution-based tax regimes where \\r\\ncorporate income tax is not payable on profit but rather on distribution of dividends. In accordance with IAS 12.52A and 57A, in \\r\\ndistribution-based tax regimes no current or deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of undistributed profits until a liability \\r\\nto pay dividends is recognised. As a market practice in Estonia, this accounting policy has been applied consistently to all \\r\\nundistributed profits in the group, regardless of whether those profits accumulated in the parent or in the subsidiaries. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2020, IFRS Interpretation Committee made an agenda decision where it concluded that the principle set out in IAS 12.52A \\r\\nand 57A only applies to undistributed profits accumulated in the parent company and does not apply to undistributed profits \\r\\naccumulated in the subsidiaries. Instead, the principles described in IAS 12.39-40 should be followed in respect of undistributed \\r\\nprofits in subsidiaries, stipulating that a deferred tax shall be recognized in respect of such accumulated profits, unless it is \\r\\nprobable that they will not be distributed to the parent in the foreseeable future. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has assessed the potential impact of the IFRS Interpretation Committee agenda decision on its financial statements and \\r\\nwill reflect the impact in its 2020 annual financial statements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group presents financial information in interim report in the same format as it was presented in the annual financial \\r\\nstatements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019, except for several changes in classification within the \\r\\nConsolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as described below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in presentation \\r\\n\\r\\nContent of statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income has been reviewed for the Interm Report. Based on the \\r\\nreview results reclassifications were made for better understanding of the presented financial information. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 30  \\r\\n\\r\\nReclassification was made for following statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income items:  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\n1 January 2019  \\r\\nto 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nQ4 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nAs restated Change \\r\\nAs \\r\\n\\r\\npreviously \\r\\nreported \\r\\n\\r\\nAs \\r\\nrestated \\r\\n\\r\\nChange \\r\\nAs \\r\\n\\r\\npreviously \\r\\nreported \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest income calculated using the effective interest \\r\\nmethod \\r\\n\\r\\n244 765 +1 383 243 382 60 350 +30 60 320 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther similar income 56 912 -1 383 58 295 13 461 -30 13 491 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest and similar expense* -47 525 +9 985 -57 510 -16 403 +2 439 -18 842 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther operating expenses* -9 985 -9 985 0 -2 439 -2 439 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet gain on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair \\r\\nvalue through profit/loss \\r\\n\\r\\n852 -5 315 6 167 372 -4 584 4 956 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet gain on debt securities at fair value through profit or \\r\\nloss \\r\\n\\r\\n5 315 +5 315 0 4 584 +4 584 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther operating expenses** 0 +17 889 -17 889 0 +6 180 -6 180 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther administrative expenses** -165 349 -17 889 -147 460 -51 152 -6 180 -44 972 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther non-operating expenses -2 327 -1 038 -1 289 -722 +68 -790 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (-) / reversal (+) on off-balance sheet \\r\\ncommitments \\r\\n\\r\\n1 038 +1 038 0 -68 -68 0 \\r\\n\\r\\n*Cash contributions to resolution funds and quarantee schemas \\r\\n** Reclassification of other operating expenses to other administrative expenses due to review results which showed that by nature these \\r\\nexpenses were administrative expenses rather than operating expenses (legal expenses and VAT taxes, for example).  \\r\\n \\r\\nReclassification impacted the following condensed consolidated statement of cashflows items:  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n1 January 2019  \\r\\n\\r\\nto 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n As restated Change \\r\\nAs previously \\r\\n\\r\\nreported \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest expenses* 47 525 -9 985 57 510 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest paid -51 790 +9 985 -61 775 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (-) / reversal (+) on off-balance sheet commitments -1 038 -1 038 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther adjustments 2 327 +1 038 1 289 \\r\\n\\r\\n*Cash contributions to resolution funds and quarantee schemas \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and applies assumptions that affect the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements \\r\\nand the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on \\r\\nmanagement’s experience and expectations of future events. \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following financial instruments are subject to the IFRS 9 impairment requirements: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 financial assets measured at amortised cost; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFor financial instruments, which are in scope of impairment requirements, a forward-looking expected credit loss approach is \\r\\napplied and loss allowances for expected credit losses are calculated in the following way: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 31  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for Stage 1 financial instruments where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since the initial recognition \\r\\n(or financial instruments which are considered to have low credit risk) – loss allowances for expected credit losses are \\r\\ncalculated at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for Stage 2 financial instruments where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the initial recognition (but \\r\\nthey are not classified as credit impaired) - loss allowances for expected credit losses are calculated at an amount equal to \\r\\nlifetime expected credit losses; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for Stage 3 financial instruments which are treated as credit-impaired – loss allowances for expected credit losses are \\r\\ncalculated at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for additional category purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) – loss allowances for expected credit losses \\r\\nare calculated at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses regardless of the changes in credit risk during the \\r\\nlifetime of financial assets. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s expected credit loss (ECL) calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions \\r\\nregarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. The following accounting judgements and estimates of ECL \\r\\nmodels are made when determining impairments of financial assets: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2;  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 identification of unlikeliness to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 classification of forbearance and Watch list; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including \\r\\n\\r\\nthe various formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default \\r\\n\\r\\n(LGD) and exposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\uf0b7 determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic \\r\\n\\r\\nand pessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and assigning \\r\\n\\r\\nprobabilities to those scenarios; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe model applied was not changed during 2020. The macroeconomic parameters were reviewed in the first and second quarters \\r\\nof 2020 to reflect the outlook due to COVID-19. The regular IFRS 9 risk parameter review was performed in the fourth quarter \\r\\nof 2020. The parameters used for the stage 3 collective impairment calculation were updated. The review of macroeconomic \\r\\nparameters and historically observed default frequency levels (applicable for stage 1 and 2 ECL calculations) performed in the \\r\\nfourth quarter indicated that this parameter update would lead to significant reversals of ECLs. Such a reversal of ECLs was not \\r\\nconsidered acceptable taking into account a) the relative lack of effective early indicators to predict credit quality developments \\r\\nin the current crisis, b) the escalation of a second wave of infections and new lockdown measures being applied, c) the moratoria \\r\\neffects (postponed defaults) which are not covered by the model, d) the actual observed default frequency indicator potentially \\r\\nbeing not representative for future default prediction due to recent government measures. Therefore, a management overlay \\r\\nwas applied in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, changes in counting the number of days past due implementing the \\r\\nmateriality thresholds for overdue amounts in line with the regulatory requirements (Regulation (EU) 2018/171) were adopted \\r\\nin the fourth quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nMore qualitative and quantitative information on the impairment of financial assets is provided in the Note 3 General Risk \\r\\nManagement Policies. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived \\r\\nfrom active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. \\r\\nThe input to these models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement \\r\\nis required in establishing fair values. For the fair value of financial assets and liabilities refer to the Note 17. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 32  \\r\\n\\r\\n3. GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required \\r\\nin the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements as \\r\\nat 31 December 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe interim financial statements disclose information on changes directly initiated as part of the Bank’s response to the COVID-\\r\\n19 pandemic and additional information about changes implemented during the reporting period not directly related to COVID-\\r\\n19 pandemic in further sections of this note. \\r\\n\\r\\nMAIN GOALS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of risk management at Luminor is to achieve an optimal balance between the risk of losses and the earnings potential in \\r\\na medium- and long-term perspective.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s Risk Management function as part of the second line of defence consists of the Risk Division and reports to the Chief \\r\\nRisk Officer. The Risk Division is an independent control and reporting function authorized to verify that Luminor’s business and \\r\\nsupporting divisions operate within the set risk appetite and risk strategy. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo further facilitate the leveraging of synergies between departments, the Risk Division is reorganized as of 1 January 2021.  The \\r\\nfirst line of defence tasks previously performed by the Market & Liquidity Risk Department were extracted into the Markets & \\r\\nTreasury Middle Office, which was moved to the Corporate Banking Division. The new organisational chart can be seen below.   \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Enterprise Risk Department is a centralized centre of expertise and manages risk management tools and processes, which \\r\\nrun across different risk types. The Credit Risk Department is responsible for credit risk control. The Operational Risk \\r\\nDepartment is responsible for operational risk control. The Market & Liquidity Risk Department is responsible for market risk \\r\\nand liquidity risk control. The Model Risk & Validation Department is responsible for model risk control and respective validation \\r\\nactivities. The Risk Data & Analytics Department combines most of the activities related to data and modelling.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCREDIT RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe unprecedent COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures imposed by most European countries had an adverse impact \\r\\non the respective economies in the first half of 2020. In particular, the social- and economic constraints imposed by governments \\r\\nacross Europe and also in the Baltic states implied a significant reduction of economic activity in the second quarter of 2020, \\r\\nincluding businesses being almost entirely shut down in certain sectors, and increasing unemployment as a consequence. Since \\r\\nLuminor is one of the largest banks in the Baltic region, many of Luminor’s customers were directly or indirectly affected by this \\r\\nsituation. In the third quarter when the restrictions were gradually lifted, the operating environment improved. However in the \\r\\nfourth quarter of 2020 the epidemiological situation worsened again leading to the reintroduction of some of the earlier lifted \\r\\nrestrictions or introduction of new restrictions. There is still significant uncertainty about the economic impact of this second \\r\\nCOVID-19 wave. \\r\\n\\r\\nA key governmental support measure was the moratoria agreements introduced by the European Banking Authority (the EBA) \\r\\nand regulated by the EBA Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria on loan repayments applied in the light of the \\r\\nCOVID-19 pandemic (EBA/GL/2020/02). Luminor Bank AS in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania have joined the \\r\\nindustry-wide private moratoria initiatives in each country, which comply with the EBA/GL/2020/02. The moratoria are \\r\\napplicable for performing COVID-19 affected customers that experience temporary financial difficulties but had acceptable \\r\\npayment discipline during the 12 months leading up to the crisis. The terms of postponements are the following:   \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for individual customers, a grace period on principal payments might be granted for up to 12 months for mortgage loans \\r\\nand for up to 6 months for consumer credits and leasing agreements; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for business customers with an exposure below 5 million EUR, the period of payment postponement is up to 6 months for \\r\\namortising products. \\r\\n\\r\\nGroup Chief Risk Officer\\r\\n\\r\\nEnterprise Risk Credit Risk Operational Risk Market & \\r\\nLiquidity Risk\\r\\n\\r\\nModel Risk & \\r\\nInternal \\r\\n\\r\\nValidation\\r\\n\\r\\nRisk Data & \\r\\nAnalytics\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 33  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nNo other conditions shall be changed. The modifications under the moratoria are not classified as forbearance. For the cases not \\r\\nmeeting moratoria conditions, individual solutions are applied and individual assessments on the exposure classification are \\r\\nperformed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe moratoria initially were meant to be in force until 30 June 2020, then were prolonged until 30 September 2020. On 2 \\r\\nDecember 2020 the EBA announced the reactivation of EBA/GL/2020/02. Industry-wide moratoria were relaunched on 18 \\r\\nJanuary 2021 in Lithuania, moratoria in Estonia and Latvia have not been prolonged. According to the relaunched moratoria the \\r\\ncumulative grace period cannot exceed 9 months for individual customers’ mortgage loans and 6 months for individual \\r\\ncustomers’ consumer credits and leasing agreements and business customers’ loans. \\r\\n\\r\\nGrace periods of COVID-19 affected, and modified exposures have already ended during 2020 for the majority (90%) of them. \\r\\nThe grace periods for the remaining 10% of exposure will end in 2021.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has been monitoring the spread of COVID-19 since early 2020 and has adjusted its risk management to the new \\r\\noperating environment. Customers where deterioration of the credit quality was observed or predicted based on the changed \\r\\noperating environment were included into the Watch list in order to monitor them more thoroughly. A Weekly Early Warning \\r\\nIndicator tracker has been established to enable close monitoring of the changes in the portfolio. Luminor furthermore follows-\\r\\nup on the performance of customers after the end of grace periods, relative to the performance of customers without \\r\\nmodifications. Luminor will continue to adjust its credit risk management as and if needed, based on internal portfolio’s trends \\r\\nand overall market situation. \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment policies \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor recognises credit losses in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9, which applies a forward-looking ECL approach. \\r\\nFor more detailed information on the impairment policies, please refer to the Note 5 General Risk Management Policies of the \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Annual Report 2019. During 2020 the impairment model remained unchanged. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn line with regulatory requirements (Regulation (EU) 2018/171), the methodological change introducing materiality thresholds \\r\\nin regard to more than 90 days past due default indicator was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor identifies default when either or both of the following default indicators materialize: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The customer is past due more than 90 days on any material overdue amount to Luminor; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 The customer is considered unlikely to pay its credit obligations to Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nCounting of days past due on a customer level starts when the overdue amount on a customer level breaches the materiality \\r\\nthresholds: \\r\\n\\uf0b7 for individual customers – more than 100 EUR and more than 1% of its credit obligations to Luminor; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 for business customers – more than 500 EUR and more than 1% of its credit obligations to Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe same principles for counting days past due taking into account materiality thresholds are applied in regard to more than 30 \\r\\ndays past due on a financial instrument significant increase in credit risk (SICR) indicator. \\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, Luminor treats a financial asset as facing SICR, if at least one of the following SICR indicators is identified after initial \\r\\nrecognition of the financial instrument and was not present as of its origination: \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Significant increase of lifetime PD – significant increase of lifetime PD since initial recognition until the reporting date (2.5 \\r\\n\\r\\ntimes and 0.6 p.p. jointly), \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Risk grade 9 or 10 – risk grade 9 or 10 as at the reporting date, \\r\\n\\uf0b7 >30 days past due – more than 30 days past due (applying materiality threshold) as at the reporting date, \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Forborne performing – forborne performing status as at the reporting date (forbearance not triggering non-performing \\r\\n\\r\\nstatus), \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Watch list – watch list status as at the reporting date. \\r\\n\\r\\nCounting of days past due on the financial instrument level starts when the overdue amount on the financial asset breaches the \\r\\nabsolute and relative materiality thresholds which are the same as on customer level (100 EUR and 1% for individual customers \\r\\nor 500 EUR and 1% for business customers). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe modifications granted for COVID-19 affected customers do not automatically indicate SICR, nor a classification to forbearance \\r\\nor default status. However, Luminor’s obligation to assess for unlikeliness to pay (which consequently triggers default status) \\r\\nremains in place.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGross amount and expected credit loss allowance amount for loans and leases as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 \\r\\nare disclosed in the tables below: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 34  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2020  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR  \\r\\nNote Gross \\r\\n\\r\\nAllowance for \\r\\nexpected credit \\r\\n\\r\\nlosses \\r\\nNet \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from banks and other credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n9 70 595 -16 70 579 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial institutions 11 132 524 -482 132 042 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic sector  11 138 599 -14 138 585 \\r\\n\\r\\n   Business customers  11 3 846 885 -78 119 3 768 766 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans   2 823 103 -61 735 2 761 368 \\r\\n\\r\\nFactoring   180 884 -2 136 178 748 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing  842 898 -14 248 828 650 \\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual customers 11 5 449 706 -58 264 5 391 442 \\r\\n\\r\\nMortgage loans  4 614 261 -44 192 4 570 069 \\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer and card loans  106 307 -1 045 105 262 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther loans  274 866 -8 935 265 931 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing  454 272 -4 092 450 180 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  9 638 309 -136 895 9 501 414 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\nNote Gross \\r\\n\\r\\nAllowance for \\r\\nexpected credit \\r\\n\\r\\nlosses \\r\\nNet \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from banks and other credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n9 141 654 -9 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial institutions 11 29 378 -123 29 255 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic sector 11 174 732 -17 174 715 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Business customers  11 4 523 201 -111 037 4 412 164 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans   3 156 365 -95 544 3 060 821 \\r\\n\\r\\nFactoring   278 511 -1 691 276 820 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing  1 088 325 -13 802 1 074 523 \\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual customers 11 5 680 911 -74 498 5 606 413 \\r\\n\\r\\nMortgage loans  4 689 319 -56 080 4 633 239 \\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer and card loans  132 862 -1 452 131 410 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther loans  325 119 -11 938 313 181 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing  533 611 -5 028 528 583 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  10 549 876 -185 684 10 364 192 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe credit quality of loans to customers as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 are disclosed in the tables below \\r\\naccording to the internal risk scale for performing customers: the probability of default for low risk rating grades (1 to 4) is in \\r\\nthe range from 0.00% to 0.75%, for moderate risk rating grades (5 to 7) the probability ranges from 0.75% to 3.00%, for high \\r\\nrisk rating grades (from 8 to 10) it ranges from 3.00% to 40.00%.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe portfolio distribution as at 31 December 2020 shows an increase in Stage 2 (mostly due to inclusion of customers in Watch-\\r\\nlist, forbearance measures applied and downgrades) and decrease in Stage 3 (outflow outweighs the inflow of new non-\\r\\nperforming exposures) compared to the end of year 2019.

Each manager and process owner within the bank is responsible for the management of risks inherent in the \\r\\nactivities and processes within their respective area. This includes fostering a sound risk culture in their respective reporting \\r\\nlines to ensure that employees understand the operations that are performed by them, the risks inherent in these, and the \\r\\nimportance of controls they execute or oversee the execution of.   \\r\\n\\r\\nA key objective of the Operational Risk Department is to identify any deviations of Luminor’s operational risk profile from the \\r\\ndesired risk level that is stated in the Risk Appetite Framework, and to do so in a timely manner to ensure any deviations can be \\r\\neffectively managed without significant detriment to the bank, its customers or other stakeholders. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Luminor operates a system of predefined controls in the form of COVID-19 response \\r\\nstates.  These response states allow management to quickly and effectively increase or decrease COVID-19 related restrictions \\r\\nand limitations in response to perceived threat and risk levels.  The COVID-19 response states are designed as a baseline to \\r\\nmanage the risk to Luminor and the bank’s stakeholders and are country-based.  Should there be a variation between the \\r\\nrestrictions in the relevant COVID-19 response state and local governmental rules or advice, the more conservative of the two \\r\\nwill prevail. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor management is kept updated on the status of operational risk through periodic and ad hoc risk reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nMARKET RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has a low risk appetite for market risk, which is defined as the risk of losses from on- and off-balance sheet positions \\r\\narising from adverse movements in market parameters such as interest rates, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, equity \\r\\nprices or commodity prices. Based on Luminor’s internal risk self-assessment, the most significant parts of the market risk for \\r\\nthe Group are interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange risk, which all stayed well within internal Risk Appetite \\r\\nFramework and lower level limits, while the exposures were at similar levels as they were during the last reporting quarter. The \\r\\nsignificance of other risks is lower, as the Group does not have any open positions in equity instruments for trading, and all \\r\\ncommodity deals with customers are hedged with back-to-back transactions. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the major negative impact to the Group in terms of market risk could arise \\r\\nfrom credit spread risk. This risk is mitigated by limits as well as certain quality requirements for the liquidity bond portfolio. \\r\\nThe Bank follows a rigorous framework for debt securities management. Bond portfolios managed by the Treasury & Asset and \\r\\nLiability Management Department and Markets Department are restricted in terms of size, level of quality, region and \\r\\ncounterparty, limiting credit risk exposure. \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations in time, the risk of incurring losses \\r\\ndue to a sudden decrease in financial resources (e.g. a financial crisis situation may result in a delay of incoming payments) or an \\r\\nincrease of the price of new resources for refinancing. The consequence of liquidity risk may be failure to meet obligations to \\r\\nrepay depositors and fulfil loan commitments.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed to ensure a constant ability to settle contractual obligations. The Group has developed a set of early \\r\\nwarning indicators and limits for a timely identification of liquidity crises, and business and funding contingency plans to manage \\r\\nthe Group’s liquidity during market disruptions. The liquidity risk management strategy is reviewed at least annually or after any \\r\\nsignificant change in the internal or external environment the Group operates in.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed across the three lines of defence: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The first line of defence comprises the Group’s Treasury & Asset and Liability Management (TALM) department and the \\r\\nbusiness areas. TALM is responsible for the daily liquidity management and funds transfer pricing (FTP). To ensure the \\r\\nfunding in situations where Luminor is in urgent need of cash and the normal funding sources do not suffice, Luminor \\r\\nholds a liquidity buffer that consists of Central Bank cash and high quality securities that can be readily sold or used as \\r\\ncollateral for funding operations;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The Market and Liquidity Risk department is the second line of defence and is responsible for providing independent \\r\\noversight and control of liquidity risk and the first line of defence; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The Internal Audit function is the third line of defence, which is responsible for providing independent assurance over the \\r\\nfirst and second lines of defence activities. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLiquidity risk management has a focus on short term obligations and more structural long-term liquidity risk applying different \\r\\ninternal and external metrics. The Group uses a range of liquidity metrics for measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 41  \\r\\n\\r\\nincluding the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), internal liquidity limits and trigger events, \\r\\nand the survival horizon metric as a part of liquidity stress testing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of intraday and short-term liquidity management is to meet the daily need for funds to ensure compliance with the \\r\\nreserve and liquidity requirements set by the ECB, as well as compliance with internal liquidity limits. Short-term liquidity is \\r\\nmaintained through the daily monitoring of the liquidity status, day-to-day funding and trading the appropriate financial \\r\\ninstruments for liquidity purposes. Long-term liquidity risk management is supported by analysing the estimated future cash \\r\\nflows considering deposit and loan portfolio growth, as well as possible refinancing sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of liquidity risk assessment, the liquidity gap is analysed considering the maturity of cash flows. The liquidity \\r\\nrisk is restricted by imposing internal limits on the liquidity gap. Utilisation of this limit is subject to regular monitoring and \\r\\nreporting to management bodies in the Group. The liquidity gap is calculated by analysing the Group’s net refinancing situation \\r\\nwithin one week, one month and three months applying a \"business as usual\" approach. Liquid assets and short-term liabilities \\r\\nare included in liquidity gap calculations for respective terms (1 week to 3 months). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe LCR is calculated as the ratio of a credit institution’s liquidity buffer to its net liquidity outflows over a 30-calendar-day stress \\r\\nperiod and is expressed as a percentage. The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of the Group’s liquidity risk \\r\\nprofile and requires the holding of risk-free assets that may be easily liquidated to meet required payments for outflows net of \\r\\ninflows during a thirty-day crisis period without support from the central bank. The minimum regulatory limit of LCR is set at \\r\\n100%, however the Group has a substantial buffer over it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe NSFR is defined as the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding over a one-year \\r\\ntime horizon. The minimum requirement for NSFR is 100%, however the Group has a substantial buffer and maintains a higher \\r\\nratio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has set the limits in place for various measures, including LCR, NSFR, liquidity gaps, and manages those within the set \\r\\nlimits by ensuring the proper maturity structure of its assets and liabilities, for example, via issuing long dated debt.

Accounts where the Group held 4.8 billion EUR at the end of December \\r\\n2020. This buffer can be utilized at any time when the need arises. On top of the Central Bank Accounts, the buffer also includes \\r\\nthe liquidity bond portfolio (excluding Markets’ assets as per the internal definition of the liquidity buffer) of 275 million EUR \\r\\nconsisting mainly of debt securities issued by Baltic governments.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity buffer is supported by the contractual agreement for funding with shareholders DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank \\r\\nAbp. Together with the capability to issue covered bonds, these strongly mitigate the likelihood of funding liquidity risk, which \\r\\nmay be caused by deposit run-off, wholesale funding risk (roll-over and new issuance), unexpected outflows from off-balance \\r\\nsheet obligations and legal risks (e.g. not being able to issue funding due to legal restrictions). This agreement introduces the \\r\\nrequirement for collateral as the facility is collateralized with assets, primarily with mortgages.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group is taking part in the ECB’s Eurosystem open market operations. In particular, the Group is a user of the ECB Targeted \\r\\nLong Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) which also requires collateral. Another source of encumbrance arises from issued \\r\\nCovered Bonds.  Encumbrance arising from pledged assets is reported and monitored. The collateral is managed by monitoring \\r\\nthe fulfilment of the requirements for each type of collateral. \\r\\n\\r\\nSurvival horizon \\r\\n\\r\\nThe key metric for liquidity risk appetite set in the Risk Appetite Framework is the survival horizon analysed across different \\r\\nstress scenarios. The survival horizon is defined as a period with a positive cumulative cash flow. It is used to capture the liquidity \\r\\nbuffer available outright to be used in liquidity stress situations within 12 months. The outcome of liquidity stress testing is the \\r\\nnumber of days the Group can withstand a liquidity crisis considering Luminor’s mitigating capacity, for example the liquidity \\r\\nbuffer. \\r\\n\\r\\nThree different scenarios are considered while measuring the survival horizon: bank-specific, market-wide and the combination \\r\\nof the most severe assumptions from the previous two. Stress testing assumptions include but are not limited to severe deposit \\r\\nwithdrawals, including early termination of term deposits and run-off of top 5 depositors, deterioration of financial assets, \\r\\ndecrease of loan repayment levels, increase of utilization of credit commitments, as well as limited availability of credit lines from \\r\\nshareholders based on the existing Facility Agreement. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 46  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity buffer for the survival horizon metric is strongly affected by the assumption of outgoing deposits in the first few \\r\\ndays and weeks of the turbulence period, with the smaller continuous run-off occurring in the following months. Due to rather \\r\\nhigh concentration of top depositors, the Group tests resistance towards a run-off of the 5 largest depositors as well. Total funds \\r\\nof the top 5 largest depositors amounted to 2 008 million EUR at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 1 347 million \\r\\nEUR at the end of 2019. Despite that the Group has sufficient liquidity and can survive for longer than a 1-year period without \\r\\nany additional support.  Furthermore, the majority of the liquidity buffer consists of cash held within central banks and highly \\r\\nliquid debt securities which serves to mitigate the consequences of deteriorating liquidity in case of high outflows.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s liquidity situation is sufficiently strong to survive severe external \\r\\nshocks. \\r\\n\\r\\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s regulatory capital consists solely of Tier 1/Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Tier1/CET1 capital consists of \\r\\nordinary shares, share premium, mandatory reserve, retained earnings of the previous financial year, the audited profit of the \\r\\ncurrent financial year and less the intangible assets, deferred tax assets, revaluation profit of investment properties, current year \\r\\nlosses, if any, and other deductions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital is calculated and allocated for risk coverage following the regulations in the CRD IV and CRR of the EU and the \\r\\napplicable regulatory requirements. The Group’s objectives in capital management are as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 consistency with Luminor Group’s long-term strategy (including meeting the risk appetite of the Group) and the Dividend \\r\\npolicy; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 the ability to pursue the business objectives; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 fulfilment of both internal and external capitalisation targets (capital adequacy); \\r\\n\\uf0b7 sufficient and proper composition of capital that would withstand stressful events. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe capital adequacy assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in accordance with the information guidelines for the risk \\r\\nmanagement and capital adequacy disclosure (Pillar 3) report. \\r\\n\\r\\nQuantitative information regarding the capital managed by the Group is presented below: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nAccording to the prudential requirements, the Pillar 2 requirement set by the ECB in the 2019 Joint Decision on Capital and the \\r\\nSystemic risk and Countercyclical risk buffer requirements set by the Central Banks of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, Luminor \\r\\n\\r\\n thousand EUR 31 December 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nOWN FUNDS     \\r\\n\\r\\n1.

The Group does not apply any Value at Risk (VaR) or other internal models for the calculation \\r\\nof the market risk capital requirement and applies the Basic Indicators Approach for calculating the operational risk capital \\r\\nrequirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk-weighted assets are measured by means of risk weights classified according to the nature of each asset and counterparty, \\r\\ntaking into account the collaterals and guarantees eligible for risk mitigation. A similar treatment with some adjustments is \\r\\nadopted for the off-balance sheet exposures. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group reviews and improves the risk identification and management policies and procedures according to changes in the \\r\\nGroup’s activities and financial situation at least once a year. Amendments and updates are mostly done during the annual \\r\\ninternal capital adequacy assessment process when significant risks are to be reassessed or identified and assessed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group complied with all externally imposed capital requirements during the reporting period. \\r\\n\\r\\nGOING CONCERN \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor’s management is fully convinced of a stable and balanced performance going forward and based on that, prepared \\r\\nthese financial statements on a going concern basis. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 48  \\r\\n\\r\\n4.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where \\r\\nthe fair values of financial assets and liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active \\r\\nmarkets, they are determined in a way that unobservable inputs used to measure fair value would reflect the assumptions that \\r\\nmarket participants would use when pricing assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risk. Where observable \\r\\nmarket data is not available, expert judgment is required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements, \\r\\nthe above-mentioned techniques related to unobservable inputs were not used as no such financial assets and liabilities exist on \\r\\nthe statement of financial position of the Group.  \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 56  \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTISED COSTS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR  \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2020 31 December 2020 31 December 2019 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortised cost         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 4 926 520 4 926 520 2 924 019 2 924 019 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 70 579 70 579 141 645 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 9 430 835 9 107 048 10 222 547 10 324 772 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 14 427 934 14 104 147 13 288 211 13 390 436 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n85 241 85 241 980 692 980 692 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 11 783 762 11 783 762 10 235 443 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 1 201 232 1 200 230 651 716 653 967 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 14 705 14 705 45 303 45 303 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 13 084 940 13 083 938 11 913 154 11 915 405 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarises the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities. Financial \\r\\ninstruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value:  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the \\r\\nmeasurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and shall be used \\r\\nwithout adjustment to measure fair value whenever available; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Level 2 — valuation techniques for which inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 are observable for the \\r\\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must \\r\\nbe observable for a substantial part of the term of the asset or liability; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Level 3 — valuation techniques for which inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be \\r\\nused to measure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations \\r\\nin which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value \\r\\nmeasurement objective remains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market \\r\\nparticipant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs shall reflect the assumptions that \\r\\nmarket participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 57  \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 31 December 2020 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using \\r\\n \\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 4 926 520 0 0 4 926 520 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 70 556 23 0 70 579 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 9 107 048 9 107 048 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial assets 0 0 10 226 10 226 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading     \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 2 857 0 0 2 857 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss     \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 2 682 0 2 682 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities     \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral governments 251 143 0 0 251 143 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 24 085 0 0 24 085 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial corporations 0 0 6 239 6 239 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments     \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 42 739 668 43 407 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive \\r\\nincome \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 140 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  5 275 161 45 444 9 124 321 14 444 926 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are disclosed     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 55 267 29 974 0 85 241 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 10 696 739 1 087 023 11 783 762 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 499 265 700 965 0 1 200 230 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 14 705 14 705 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value     \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments     \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 49 236 1 347 50 583 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  554 532 11 476 914 1 103 075 13 134 521 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 58  \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 31 December 2019 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using \\r\\n \\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 2 924 019 0 0 2 924 019 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 141 596 49 0 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 10 324 772 10 324 772 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial assets 0  0 29 113 29 113 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value         \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading         \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 3 021 0 0 3 021 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss         \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 4 033 0 4 033 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities         \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral governments 195 989 0 0 195 989 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 15 023 0 0 15 023 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial corporations 0 0 12 851 12 851 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments         \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 58 087 1 130 59 217 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive \\r\\nincome \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 140 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  3 279 648 62 169 10 368 006 13 709 823 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities         \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are disclosed         \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 29 080 951 612 0 980 692 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 8 074 410 2 161 033 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 653 967 0 653 967 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 45 303 45 303 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value         \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments         \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 56 042 2 262 58 304 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  29 080 9 736 031 2 208 598 11 973 709 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Non-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss (Pension Funds) -

Pension fund units are revalued according to the effective net \\r\\nasset value on the balance sheet date;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Cash and cash balances with central banks – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at \\r\\nthe same price in an orderly transaction;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Due from other credit institutions – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at the same \\r\\nprice in an orderly transaction. Due from other credit institutions are demand deposits;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Loans to customers – fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows with the loan portfolio \\r\\naverage rate which was calculated based on the Bank new sales margin of the fourth quarter of 2020 and total volume of \\r\\nthe loan portfolio that included credit risk factors. Same valuation technique is applied to all loan classes and accordingly \\r\\nall loan classes are classified under fair value level 3. As at 31 December 2019 fair value was estimated by discounting \\r\\nestimated future cash flows with the base curve used by the Bank (6m Euribor curve as average for all loans) as adjusted \\r\\nby credit risk factors; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (debt securities) - for domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic \\r\\nstates, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish \\r\\nthe trading offers in the form of prices, yields or equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the \\r\\naverage of bid prices shall be used taking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic \\r\\nstates, or there are no quotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers \\r\\nare clearly incorrect or artificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data using \\r\\nsources like Bloomberg or similar; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the interest \\r\\nrates for items with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured using the assumptions \\r\\nthat market participants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best \\r\\ninterest;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (equities, debt securities):  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source for local equities. These are securities \\r\\nfor which active market exists based on the turnover, meaning availability of quotes at which market \\r\\nparticipants transact in the local stock market. The quotes of foreign equities shall be taken from Bloomberg \\r\\ngiving the priority to the primary market, and then to the country of issuer if the active market exists there. \\r\\nOtherwise, the market with the highest liquidity (turnover) shall be used as a source for pricing. If the quotes \\r\\nin primary data sources are clearly incorrect or artificial, the price of particular equity shall be derived from \\r\\nliquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or similar. Correctness of the quotes described above are the \\r\\nsubject of expert judgment of the Market & Liquidity Risk Department member together with the Bank’s \\r\\nMarkets Department’s dealer responsible for equity trading. For equities of non-listed companies for which \\r\\nactive market does not exist, any available trusted public information on recent trades shall be used for the \\r\\npricing of the equity. Alternatively, dividend discount model shall be used to determine the price of equity. \\r\\nExpert opinion based on other available related market data shall be used for pricing of equity if the previously \\r\\ndescribed methods are not possible;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 For domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be \\r\\nthe priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading offers in the form of prices, yields \\r\\nor equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid prices shall be used \\r\\ntaking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no \\r\\nquotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are \\r\\nclearly incorrect or artificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data \\r\\nusing sources like Bloomberg or similar;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Derivative financial instruments – market data from financial data vendors, electronic trading platforms or third-party \\r\\nvaluation are used for valuation purposes. The derivatives represent non-complex products valued with generally \\r\\naccepted models. Valuation inputs are derived from the market data;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Loans and deposits from credit institutions – the fair value of loans equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the loans from \\r\\ncredit institutions is under market conditions. Expected cash flows of the liabilities from the banks are discounted with \\r\\nthe same market rates as loans. Loans from credit institutions are long-term. Deposits from credit institutions are demand \\r\\ndeposits. The fair value of deposits equals to their carrying value.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by the IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as the Management Board. The \\r\\nManagement Board monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about \\r\\nresource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit before tax and is measured \\r\\nconsistently with profit before tax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of expenses after \\r\\ninternal funds transfer pricing, as management primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a \\r\\nperformance measure. Fees and commission income for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made \\r\\nbetween different product categories for segment reporting.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for two main operating segments: Corporate Banking and Retail Banking. Operating segments are \\r\\nreported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. Corporate Banking segment services business \\r\\ncustomers that have a dedicated relationship manager and all leasing customers who do not have a bank relationship. Retail \\r\\nBanking segment services business customers without a dedicated relationship manager, private individuals and holding \\r\\ncompanies associated with wealthy private individuals. Results of other operating segments are included in Other segment.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 62  \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments \\r\\n(including internal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Other segment) and income and expenses not \\r\\nbooked on customer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using internally agreed allocation mechanisms. \\r\\nOnly assets and liabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating segments are reported under the respective \\r\\nsegments, all other balance sheet items are not reported under the operating segments to CODM. Loans and Deposits are reported \\r\\nunder operating segments at Gross amounts (and excluding accrued interest). Net impairment (losses/reversal) on loans to \\r\\ncustomers is monitored for each of the segments at Profit or Loss side, while at the Assets side, the CODM only monitors Gross \\r\\namounts of Loans to customers, with impairment allowances not being allocated to operating segments.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first quarter of 2020 it was decided to transfer customers with leasing exposures but without a relationship to bank \\r\\nentities from Other segment to Corporate segment and restatement was made also to historic periods. From the fourth quarter \\r\\nof 2020 it was decided to transfer Wealth Management segment customers under Retail Banking segment and restatement was \\r\\nmade also to historic periods.  From the first quarter of 2020 Luminor started applying Activity Based Costing to allocate \\r\\npersonnel costs, administrative costs and depreciation between operating segments and restatement was also made to segment \\r\\nsplit of costs to 2019 figures. The asymmetrical allocation of allowance for impairment Net impairment (losses/reversal) on loans \\r\\nto customers, as described above, was applied from the second quarter of 2020.

Luminor is an Estonian registered credit \\r\\ninstitution, with sizable branches in Lithuania and Latvia. From here on we will focus on creating a pan-Baltic, modern, and flexible \\r\\norganization to be a valuable business partner to our customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nHaving been born from the merger of the Baltic operations of two Northern Europe’s largest financial institutions we will use this \\r\\nglobal knowhow to become the best financial partner in the Baltics for the local way of life and doing business, who is independent \\r\\nand free to proceed in our decisions from local interests. We will do this by being entrepreneurial, collaborative and open, and offering \\r\\nthe best in customer experience, value management and solutions to meet the needs of our present and future customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe economic environment of the Baltic countries has continued to be favorable for our plans. We have taken advantage of healthy \\r\\ngrowth rates in GDP, almost full employment, balanced current accounts, a as well as healthy levels of saving rates and close to \\r\\nbalanced budgets. We see the economic backdrop remaining positive and supportive in the coming quarters as well.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first quarter of this year has been full of various activities. A lot of emphasis has been put on efficiency, as we have continued the \\r\\nprocesses of adjusting our operating model and building the foundation for future Luminor. We have harmonized overhead and group \\r\\nfunctions and removed duplicated activities. Our staff reductions are also progressing as planned. We continue to move ahead with \\r\\nour ongoing initiatives to simplify our products and services portfolio, to make the bank more accessible to all customers. We are \\r\\nlaunching a major initiative to upgrade online services across our three home markets, towards both households and corporates. Very \\r\\nintense work is going on in the field of system consolidation and migration. Our focus is on carving out and improving Luminor's IT \\r\\nenvironment and in that way further improve our efficiency.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are continuously improving our funding position and growing our deposit base. Our deposits across all segments have grown by \\r\\nmore than EUR 1 billion compared to the same period in 2018, and the loans to deposits ratio has improved to 120.1% by the end of \\r\\nthis quarter. This is a great development in terms of supporting Luminor's funding independence and efficient balance sheet \\r\\nmanagement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFighting financial crime will remain one of our key priorities, as it has been since the creation of Luminor. Our proficiency in monitoring \\r\\nand detecting cases of attempted or suspicious money laundering is continuously improving. \\r\\n\\r\\nA consortium led by funds managed by Blackstone signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake of Luminor in September 2018. \\r\\nWhile the transaction remains subject to regulatory approval of the European Central Bank and local regulators, then based on the \\r\\ncurrent state of the approval process, the parties expect to close the transaction no later than during second half of 2019. Luminor´s \\r\\ntransformation is one of the biggest and most interesting of its kind in the Baltics. We are directing all our investments and efforts \\r\\ntowards our vision to create a modern, accessible and truly Baltic  financial partner we think our customers deserve. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n   \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 4  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nOverview \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor (Luminor Bank AS) was established on 1 October 2017 as a result of the merger of DNB Bank ASA (Commercial Register no. \\r\\n984 851 006) and Nordea Bank AB (Swedish Commercial Register no. 516406-0120) operations in the Baltic countries to create a new-\\r\\ngeneration financial service provider for local businesses and financially active people.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest financial services provider in the Baltics, with approximately 1 million clients, 2760 employees, 17% market \\r\\nshare in deposits and 21% market share in lending as at the end of first quarter 2019. Total shareholders’ equity amounts to EUR 1.8 \\r\\nbillion and Luminor is capitalized with a CET1 ratio of 20%. Luminor’s vision is to become the best financial ecosystem for its customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, an agreement was signed between DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank AB with US-based private equity firm \\r\\nBlackstone to sell the majority stake in Luminor. As part of the transaction, Blackstone will acquire a 60% majority stake in the bank. \\r\\nNordea and DNB will retain equal 20% equity stakes in Luminor and will continue to support the bank with long term funding, \\r\\nexpertise, and ongoing representation on the Supervisory Council.

The average annual growth rate for 2017-18 has exceeded 4% in Estonia and Latvia, with \\r\\na robust 3.8% boost in Lithuania. This compares to a close to two percent average GDP advance in the Euro area.  \\r\\n\\r\\nA shift from de-synchronized growth to synchronized moderation of global growth may well be the core economic theme for 2019, \\r\\nwith risks emanating from softer global trade and waning momentum across developed and emerging countries. This can also taper \\r\\nexport revenues in the open Baltic economies. Euro area annual GDP growth decelerated from 1.6% in third quarter of 2018 to only \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 5  \\r\\n\\r\\n1.1% in last quarter, with softer contribution from industrial and trade sectors. Incoming data continues to be weak, especially for the \\r\\nmanufacturing sector, mainly on account of the slowdown in external demand, which has been compounded by some country- and \\r\\nsector-specific factors. As the impact of these factors is turning out to be somewhat longer-lasting, the slower growth momentum is \\r\\nexpected to extend into the current year. Looking ahead, the effect of these adverse factors is expected to unwind. \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the weaker backdrop in external markets the Baltic countries sustained a strong broad-based economic momentum in second \\r\\nhalf of 2018 with growth picking up towards the year end, increasing to 4.1%, 5.4%, and 3.3% annual pace respectively in Estonia, \\r\\nLatvia and Lithuania. While the domestic demand has remained the key growth engine, exports have also expanded at a healthy rate \\r\\nespecially in Estonia and Lithuania. Latvia continues to exceed expectations with strong performance in consumption and \\r\\ninvestments, with the help of EU structural funds and industry appetite for investments. Structural changes proceed at a healthy pace \\r\\nwith the share of more dynamic high value-added services (ICT, business services), and manufacturing (machinery, chemicals) \\r\\nexpanding. The Baltic countries expansion will continue to be supported by rising wages, moderating inflationary pressures and \\r\\nfurther employment gains, and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – expansion in Euro area and Nordic countries.    \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nActivities \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries through the Estonian \\r\\nhead-quartered bank and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger all assets, rights and liabilities of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank continues the \\r\\nactivities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches. A new organizational set up, a new governance structure, \\r\\nand new members of management bodies were also introduced. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe deposits and financial instruments of the depositors and customers using investment services of Luminor Bank AS Latvian branch \\r\\nand Luminor Bank AS Lithuanian branch are guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and investor protection scheme established and \\r\\noperated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 January 2019 Luminor proceeded with the next phase of transformation. The bank aims to transform its operating model by \\r\\nsimplifying its structure and decision process, unifying and executing IT consolidation, strengthening its controls, and becoming more \\r\\nefficient, more resilient and more resolvable. Due to this Luminor team was reduced by 266 employees during first quarter of 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn first quarter the start of customer data and services transfer to unified Luminor system was announced in Latvia and Lithuania. \\r\\nDigital team continued their efforts on developing new Luminor digital channels and preparing our current channels for customer \\r\\ndata transfer process. The main task of this process is to offer similar functional possibilities to customers transferred and secure \\r\\nsmooth and uninterrupted services to our customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe code cards still used in Latvia and Lithuania as customer authorization tool will be discontinued in the second part of the year. \\r\\nThe customers are encouraged to discover other modern digital authorization tools and offered help in starting using them.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOpen Banking developer portal was launched in the first quarter. We are also progressing with setting up more automated process \\r\\nin consumer and mortgage loans area. \\r\\n\\r\\nRETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking management model has been adjusted to support delivering excellence in customer experience and meeting our \\r\\ncustomers’ needs. In January Luminor announced the transformation of its customer service centers network as part of the bank´s \\r\\nstrategic initiative to be carried out during 2019. The plan consists of consolidating certain customer service centers into nearby \\r\\nlocations, revisiting customer service model, strengthening the bank´s digital service offer, and introducing customers to cashless \\r\\nplatforms and payment systems.   \\r\\n\\r\\nRetail banking team has consolidated its marketing and sales campaigns across the Baltics and initiated the first pan-Baltic sales \\r\\ncampaign with aligned offer. The campaign has resulted in the growth of retail customer deposits by 14.1% in the first quarter \\r\\ncompared to the same period in 2018. The lending volumes for retail customers remained stable during the quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nA lending centralization project has also been implemented and has resulted in knowledge centralization and increased effectiveness \\r\\nin decision making.  At the end of first quarter this year, Luminor serviced its customers in total 50 customer service centers across \\r\\nthe Baltics.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 6  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn first quarter of 2019 servicing of the Corporate Banking customers was consolidated into a pan-Baltic Corporate Banking division. \\r\\nAs a part of this change, our smaller corporate customers will be served in the Retail Banking division going forward. This change \\r\\nallows Corporate Banking to increase efficiency and improve service quality for our largest corporate customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the quarter, the deposit volumes in the Corporate Banking segment continued to increase with growth rates reaching 17% \\r\\ncompared to the same period in 2018. Loan portfolio contracted somewhat due to our focus on improving profitability of our assets. \\r\\nRisk-related costs were slightly positive, as loan write-backs still outweigh new provisions, as a result of positive macro-economic \\r\\nenvironment. \\r\\n\\r\\nWEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nWealth Management Segment has been introduced in the first quarter 2019 by merging our Private Banking, Asset Management, and \\r\\nPensions segments.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWealth Management is focusing on continued consolidation of pan-Baltic operations by transforming from a country based \\r\\norganizational set up to a pan-Baltic set up and development of the team. Cooperation with other business segments, customer \\r\\nsatisfaction, participation in pension reforms in Lithuania and Latvia, and developing new sales channels in Estonia were among the \\r\\nmain priorities during the quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first quarter 2019 pension assets under management in Baltics reached EUR 1.28 billion, up 12% compared to same period in \\r\\n2018. Luminor had 309 thousand second pillar and 64 thousand third pillar pension customers at the end of the quarter. Luminor's \\r\\nlong-term performance of pension funds is among the best in the market in both second and third pillar funds.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking focuses on growing assets under management and keeping a high level of customer satisfaction, by helping affluent \\r\\nand high net worth individuals and their families to grow, manage, and preserve their wealth. During the quarter Private Banking \\r\\nfocused on attracting new customers with several macro- and investments-related seminars. The team has continued the \\r\\ncollaboration with Luminor’s other business segments to help deliver results. Efforts were also put towards new products, helping to \\r\\nimplement competitive daily banking offering. During the first quarter 2019 assets under management grew 9% compared to the \\r\\nsame period in 2018. Luminor has around 3,300 Private Banking customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN LUMINOR  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is creating a new-generation financial services provider because it is determined to build a better tomorrow – for families \\r\\nand businesses and for the communities and countries in which we live and operate.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is committed to taking into account corporate governance, social conditions and environment in all the activities, including \\r\\nproduct and service development, advisory services and sales, investment and credit decisions, and other operations. Luminor does \\r\\nnot contribute to the infringement of human or labor rights, corruption, environmental harm or other actions that could be regarded \\r\\nas unethical. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a responsibility to make an effort to ensure that the banking industry delivers ethical products and services. We take \\r\\nresponsibility for whom our products and services are offered to, as well as how. \\r\\n\\r\\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING RELATED MATTERS  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has chosen to serve primarily customers having a strong presence and connection to the Baltic countries. When focusing on \\r\\nserving Baltic customers, we continuously aim for a full transparency in customers’ background, availability of KYC data, and economic \\r\\nrationale of activities. Luminor has a zero tolerance towards money laundering, financing of terrorism, and other financial crime. \\r\\nLuminor has developed and implemented a comprehensive set of measures to identify, manage and control its risks. We comply with \\r\\nsanctions laws and follow the guidelines, recommendations and standards issued by regulatory and supervisory authorities and \\r\\nrelevant international organizations, as well as those issued by local banking associations and financial intelligence units in each Baltic \\r\\nstate. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll our anti-financial crime compliance functions are operating at the pan-Baltic level, having competence centers and highly \\r\\nexperienced and certified professionals in the following areas: data protection (DPO), AML (CAMS), Fraud Examiners, FATCA, IT \\r\\ncompliance and digital channels, business integrity, bank products and new product development. Luminor’s Compliance division \\r\\nemploys around 100 professionals, maintaining a robust compliance framework and processes throughout the organization. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 7  \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 31 MARCH 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 May 2019 the Supervisory Council of Luminor has appointed Jonas Eriksson as the CFO and member of the Management Board \\r\\nof Luminor, effective from 1 May 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nBeing capitalised well above the applicable regulatory requirements and internal targets, Luminor Bank has decided to pay out part \\r\\nof the excess capital to its sole shareholder, Luminor Group AB, the main shareholders of which are Nordea Bank Abp and DNB Bank \\r\\nASA. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s current total capital ratio of 20 percent is well above the internal target of 17 percent. The internal target is deemed \\r\\nsufficient to meet all regulatory requirements and the capital needed to deliver Luminor’s business strategy. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo facilitate the distribution, Luminor Group as the sole shareholder of Luminor Bank, made a decision on 28 May 2019 to approve \\r\\nLuminor Bank converting part of its share premium to share capital via a bonus share issuance, followed by a share capital reduction \\r\\nto effect the distribution. Luminor has received regulatory approval from the European Central Bank for such actions. The distribution \\r\\nwill be paid once the legal waiting period of 3 months has elapsed. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the completion of the bonus issue and the subsequent reduction of share capital, the share capital of Luminor Bank AS will \\r\\nremain on the same level as it is now at EUR 34 912 230. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 8  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Results \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries through the Estonian \\r\\nregistered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all assets and liabilities \\r\\nof three Banks have been consolidated as of 2 January 2019. The 2018 comparable figures in Q1 2019 interim report of Luminor Bank \\r\\nAS include also the financial results of the Luminor Bank Latvia and Luminor Bank Lithuania, as if they had been merged prior to 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit earned in the first quarter 2019 was EUR 26.4 million, down EUR 7.0 million compared to the same period in 2018. As \\r\\nannounced earlier in February this year, Luminor has entered its next phase of transformation and is changing its operating model. \\r\\nTo accelerate this transformation, the new model foresees simplifying the bank’s business processes and reorganizing duplicated \\r\\nfunctions and areas, where new technological approaches and organizational solutions are being introduced. As a part of the process, \\r\\nLuminor is also decreasing team size and has filed collective redundancy notification. This has resulted in an increase of total operating \\r\\nexpenses in the first quarter by EUR 2.1 million compared to the same period in 2018. Total operating expenses were EUR 59.6 million, \\r\\nincluding net reversal on loans to customers EUR 7.5 million and extraordinary expenses EUR 17.2 million mostly related to IT expenses \\r\\n(43%), staff expenses (32%) and other transformation costs (25%). \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time underlying business performance contributed positively to the results. Interest income was up EUR 1 million during \\r\\nthe quarter compared to the same period prior year. The loans to deposits ratio improved by 16% compared to the same period in \\r\\n2018, from 142.6% to 120.1% in first quarter 2019, due to increase in deposit volumes. However, higher deposit volumes also \\r\\ncontributed to an increase in interest expenses by EUR 1.6 million. \\r\\n\\r\\nKEY FIGURES OF LUMINOR*  \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR Q1 2019 Q1 2018 2018 FY** \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit 26 367 33 407 124 949 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity 1 810 069 1 707 822 1 757 148 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) % 5.9 7.9 7.1 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets 14 725 789 14 842 924 15 201 023 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) % 0.7 0.9 0.8 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 65 980 66 766 259 733 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets 14 374 728 14 471 261 14 844 146 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) % 1.9 1.9 1.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio (C/I) % 77.2 61.9 62.3 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio %*** -0.26 0.02 -0.06 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet loans 11 282 787 11 587 126 11 472 138 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 9 391 341 8 123 965 9 069 885 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to Deposits ratio % 120.1 142.6 126.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio % 20.0  17.6 18.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio (gross) % 4.6  5.5  5.3 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n* Quarterly ratios and Jan-March 2019 ratios (ROE, ROA, NIM, C/I, Credit impairment ratio) have been expressed on an annualized basis \\r\\n\\r\\n**Luminor Group AB full year consolidated figures     \\r\\n\\r\\n***If loan recoveries prevail, ratio is negative \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 9  \\r\\n\\r\\nExplanations  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity (belonging to owners of company) = (equity at end of reporting period + equity at end of previous period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) = Net profit / Average equity * 100%  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets = (assets at end of reporting period + assets at end of previous period) / 2  \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) = Net profit / Assets, average * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets = (interest-earning assets at end of reporting period + interest-earning assets at end of previous period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) = Net interest income / Interest earning assets, average * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio = Total operating expenses / Total net income * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio = Net losses/reversal on loans to customers / Net loans, average * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio = Loans to customers / Deposits from customers * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio = Common Equity Tier 1 Capital/ Risk-weighted Assets \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio = Gross impaired Loans (Stage 3 loans) / Gross Loans * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLENDING AND DEPOSITS  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers totaled EUR 11.3 billion at the end of first quarter, down 2% from previous quarter.

Deposits from customers are the main funding source for \\r\\nLuminor and make up EUR 9.4 billion or 66.4% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity, as at first quarter 2019. Additionally, \\r\\nLuminor has outstanding debt securities and funding from parent banks, among other items. The funding base is predominantly EUR-\\r\\ndenominated. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor Bank AS Senior Unsecured Medium-Term Note Program rating of Baa2. The assignment \\r\\nof rating was followed by a 350 million senior unsecured inaugural public bond issue with a maturity of 3 years and coupon of 1.50%. \\r\\nThe bond is listed on the Euronext Dublin Stock Exchange. Despite the market turbulence at the time of issuance, Luminor was able \\r\\nto attract investors around Europe, supported by strong local demand. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at the end of first quarter 2019, utilized parent funding amounts to EUR 2,048 million and is provided by the two parent banks in \\r\\nthe form of a syndicate, where each parent bank provides 50%. Long-term funding was committed for 6 years (4+2), starting from the \\r\\n1 October 2017, when Luminor was established, and short-term funding is in the form of revolving credit of 364 days. In addition to \\r\\nthe outstanding utilized funding, there is also a committed credit line of EUR 2,456 million in place. When Luminor attracts external \\r\\nwholesale long-term (over one-year term) funding, the equal amount of parent funding will be amortized. \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no changes to Luminor’s ratings in the first quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) for Luminor was 131.2% at the end of the first quarter 2019, according to the Delegated Act’s LCR \\r\\ndefinition. The liquidity buffer is composed of highly liquid central bank eligible securities and cash. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of first quarter, Luminor’s NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio) was 122.0% using a RSF (Required Stable Funding) factor of 65% \\r\\nfor qualifying collateralized mortgages. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 14  \\r\\n\\r\\n(percentage) Q1  2019* Q4 2018* Q3 2018* Q2 2018* Q1  2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 131.2% 189.0% 130.4% 131.1% 140.7% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR** 122.0% 114.0% 106.4% 114.0% 108.0% \\r\\n\\r\\n* Luminor Group AB consolidated figures \\r\\n\\r\\n**mortgages that would qualify for 35% or lower risk weight are calculated with 85% RSF factor, 65% factor implemented since 01.01.2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are pre-dominantly from residents of Baltics.

The Total Capital ratio of Luminor was 20.0% as at the end of Q1 2019 (Q4 2018: 18.8%), which is comfortably \\r\\nabove the internal target of 17.0%. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Total Capital ratio is fully covered by Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. For calculating Credit and Market risk Luminor is using \\r\\nthe Standardized method in the Capital Adequacy calculations. Operational risk is calculated using the Basic Indicator Approach \\r\\nmethod.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of Q1 2019, the Leverage Ratio, calculated according to CRR, was 12.0% (Q4 2018: 10.4%).

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE INFORMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries through the \\r\\nEstonian registered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all assets \\r\\nand liabilities of three Banks have been consolidated as of 02 January 2019. The 2018 comparatives in 2019 Q1 interim report of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS include also the financial results of the Luminor Bank Latvia and Luminor Bank Lithuania, as if they had been merged \\r\\nprior to 2018 already. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 March 2019 Luminor Bank AS owned following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Estonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country  \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Latvia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Lithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Liising AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Pensions Estonia AS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Kindlustusmaakler OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Est OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Asset Management IPAS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Finance SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Līzings SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Realm SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Skanstes 12 SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 2 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 3 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 4 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 6 SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n Trioleta SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Industrius UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Intractus UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Lit UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Recurso UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Investiciju \\r\\nvaldymas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Lizingas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (the Bank or the Group) was prepared in accordance with IAS 34 \\r\\nInterim Financial reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed interim financial information does not contain all the \\r\\ninformation and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Luminor Group \\r\\nAB (holding) annual financial statements as at 31 December 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed interim financial information are consistent with those followed \\r\\nin the preparation of the Luminor Group AB (holding) annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, except for \\r\\nthe adoption of new and amended standards as set out below. \\r\\n\\r\\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThis note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on the Group’s financial statements and discloses the new accounting \\r\\npolicies that have been applied from 1 January 2019 below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 “Leases” was issued on 13 January 2016 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The new \\r\\nstandard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. All leases result in the lessee \\r\\nobtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and, if lease payments are made over time, also obtaining financing. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 24  \\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases as is required by IAS 17 and, \\r\\ninstead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Lessees will be required to recognize: (a) assets and liabilities for all leases with \\r\\na term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value; and (b) depreciation of lease assets separately from \\r\\ninterest on lease liabilities in the income statement. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS \\r\\n17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases and account for those two types of leases \\r\\ndifferently. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 \\r\\nmonths or less and do not contain a purchase option (‘short-term leases’), and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low \\r\\nvalue (‘low-value assets’). \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustments recognised on adoption of IFRS 16 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group decided that it will apply the standard using the modified retrospective method and has not restated comparatives for the \\r\\n2018 reporting period. The Group recognized a right of use asset of 30,7 million Euro against a corresponding lease liability in the \\r\\namount of 33,2 million Euro and the impact to the equity as of 1 January 2019 amounts to 2,5 million Euro, decreasing its balance. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease liabilities as at 1 January 2019 is reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of 31 December 2018 as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR Q1 2019  \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating lease commitments disclosed as at 31 December 2018                                              36 656 \\r\\n\\r\\nWeighted average incremental borrowing rate as at 1 January 2019 2,45% \\r\\n\\r\\nDiscounted operating lease commitments at 1 January 2019 31 847 \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\nLess  \\r\\n\\r\\nCommitments relating short-term leases  158 \\r\\n\\r\\nAdd  \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments in optional extension periods not recognized as at 31 December 2018         1 518 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal lease liability recognized as at 1 January 2019 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nOf which are:       \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent lease liabilities   4 201 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-current lease liabilities   29 006 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe recognised right-of-use assets relate to the following types of assets (TEUR):   \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR 31 March 2019  1 January 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nProperties 30 529 30 529 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther assets 94 164 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal right-of-use assets 30 623 30 693 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe change in accounting policy affected the following items in the balance sheet on 1 January 2019 (TEUR):  \\r\\n\\r\\n• property, plant and equipment – increase by 30 257 TEUR \\r\\n\\r\\n• lease liabilities – increase by 33 207 TEUR \\r\\n\\r\\nThe net impact on retained earnings on 1 January 2019 was a decrease of 2,5 million Euro. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 25  \\r\\n\\r\\nAmounts recognized in the statement of financial position and profit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\nSet out below, are the carrying amounts of the Group’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and the movements during the period: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR Properties Other fixed assets Total  right-of use \\r\\n\\r\\nassets \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 01 January 2019 30 529 164 30 693 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditions 1 182 0 1 182 1 182 \\r\\n\\r\\nReductions -110 -58 -168 -168 \\r\\n\\r\\nDepreciation expense -1 072 -12 -1 084 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest expense 0 0 0 147 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments 0 0 0 -898 \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 March 2019 30 529 94 30 623 33 471 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognised rent expense from short-term leases, leases of low-value assets and variable lease payments of totally 500 \\r\\nthousand Euros for the 3 months ended 31 March 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nPractical expedients applied \\r\\n\\r\\nIn applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:   \\r\\n\\r\\n the use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics;  \\r\\n\\r\\n the accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 January 2019 as short-term \\r\\nleases.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s leasing activities and how these are accounted for \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group leases various offices and other assets (IT equipment and cars). Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 4 \\r\\nto15 years but may have extension options as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide \\r\\nrange of different terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 2018 financial year, leases of property, IT equipment and cars were classified as either finance or operating leases. Payments \\r\\nmade under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) were charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis \\r\\nover the period of the lease.   \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 January 2019, leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset \\r\\nis available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged \\r\\nto profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for \\r\\neach period.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease payments are discounted using the \\r\\ninterest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate \\r\\nthat the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment \\r\\nwith similar terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo determine incremental borrowing rate we have considered: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. existing borrowings (own funding cost) that need to be adjusted for amount, security, term etc. and \\r\\n2. property yield that need to be adjusted for term, amount, quality of property, potential weighted average cost of capital \\r\\n\\r\\n(WACC) element in yields etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor property leases we have decided the usage of the Bank’s own funding cost as a discount rate. For other assets we use the interest \\r\\nrate implicit in the lease as discount rate, as it is readily determinable. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the lease liability by:  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 26  \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;  \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and  \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications (like changes in lease term, in the assessment \\r\\nof an option to purchase the underlying asset, in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, in future \\r\\nlease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, including for example a change to \\r\\nreflect changes in market rental rates following a market rent review and in floating interest rates, or to reflect revised in-substance \\r\\nfixed lease payments (payments are structured as variable lease payments, but there is no genuine variability in those payments and \\r\\nthose payments contain variable clauses that do not have real economic substance). \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured applying a cost model. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost of the right-of-use asset comprises: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that \\r\\ndate; \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(d) an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it \\r\\nis located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are \\r\\nincurred to produce inventories. The lessee incurs the obligation for those costs either at the commencement date or as a \\r\\nconsequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the right-of-use asset measured at cost: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications, or to \\r\\nreflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in \\r\\nprofit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment and small \\r\\nitems of office furniture below 5 000 EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nEstimation uncertainty arising from variable lease payments \\r\\n\\r\\nSome property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to consumer price index. The management has assessed that \\r\\neffect from the consumer price index change is not material to the lease payments. \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These terms are \\r\\nused to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. The majority of extension and termination options held are \\r\\nexercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn determining the lease term, the management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise \\r\\nan extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included \\r\\nin the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). Potential future cash outflows have not been \\r\\nincluded in the lease liability because it is not reasonably certain that the leases will be extended (or not terminated).   \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 27  \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, and the \\r\\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are \\r\\nbased on management’s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable \\r\\nunder the circumstances. Management also makes certain judgements, apart from those involving estimations, in the process of \\r\\napplying the accounting policies. Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated \\r\\nfinancial statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the \\r\\nnext financial year include: \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 fundamentally changed the credit loss recognition methodology. The standard replaced IAS 39’s incurred loss approach with a \\r\\nforward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans \\r\\nand other debt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The allowance \\r\\nis based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default in the next twelve months unless there has been a \\r\\nsignificant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the probability of default over the life of \\r\\nthe asset. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for purchased or originated credit-impaired \\r\\nassets (POCI) regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument. The Bank has established a policy to perform \\r\\nan assessment at the end of each reporting period of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by \\r\\nconsidering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bank’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable \\r\\ninputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include: \\r\\n\\r\\n evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1, 2 or 3;  \\r\\n\\r\\n assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including the \\r\\nvarious formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\r\\n the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) \\r\\nand exposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\r\\n determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;  \\r\\n\\r\\n estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic and \\r\\npessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios; and \\r\\n\\r\\n estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for Stage 3 individual assessments and assigning probabilities to those \\r\\nscenarios \\r\\n\\r\\nThe assets to test for impairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes assets \\r\\nwhere there has been no significant increase in credit risk or which are classified as low risk (rating categorised as “Investment grade” \\r\\nor higher), stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets. \\r\\nSignificant assets in stage 3 are tested for impairment on an individual basis, while for insignificant assets a collective assessment is \\r\\nperformed. In stage 1, the allowances equal the 12-month expected credit loss. In stage 2 and 3, the allowances equal the lifetime \\r\\nexpected credit losses.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOne important driver for size of allowances under IFRS 9 is the trigger for transferring an asset from Stage 1 to Stage 2. Luminor uses \\r\\na mix of absolute and relative changes (0.6 p.p. and 2.5 times) in 12-month point-in-time Probability of Default (PD) to determine \\r\\nwhether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

The swaps are being used to hedge the \\r\\nexposure to changes in the fair value of its fixed rate 1.50% senior unsecured bond. Trade date is 10 October 2018, effective date is \\r\\n18 October 2018 and maturity date is 18 October 2021 for both interest swap agreements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instruments as the terms of the interest rate swaps \\r\\nmatch the terms of the fixed rate loan (i.e. notional amount maturity payment and reset dates). The Group has established a hedge \\r\\nratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships, as the underlying risk of the interest rate swaps is identical to the hedged risk component. \\r\\nTo test hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the \\r\\nhedging instrument against the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 31  \\r\\n\\r\\nHedge ineffectiveness can theoretically arise from: \\r\\n\\r\\n A different interest rate curve applied to discount the hedged item and hedging instrument \\r\\n\\r\\n Differences in the timing of cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument, also a different day count \\r\\n\\r\\n The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instrument and hedged item \\r\\n\\r\\n31.03.2019 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 350 000 1 694 Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial during Q1 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 350 000 1 128 Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial during 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\n9.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where \\r\\nthe fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active \\r\\nmarkets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs to \\r\\nthese models are derived from observable market data where possible, but where observable market data is not available, judgment \\r\\nis required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements mentioned techniques were not used extensively \\r\\nas no such financial assets and financial liabilities exist on the statement of financial position of the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of loans to customers, customer deposits, amounts due from credit institutions and amounts due to credit institutions \\r\\nand other financial assets and liabilities’ obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the rates \\r\\ncurrently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn assessing the fair value for financial assets, the management has performed a discounted cash flow analysis; up-to-date market \\r\\ninformation at the assessment moment is being used for assessing cash flows. For loans where base interest rates are pegged to \\r\\nfloating market interest rates, the Group has considered the difference between the average interest margin of issued loans and the \\r\\naverage interest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has been changed (increased) \\r\\nsince issuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal to the fair value. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of financial liabilities at amortized cost such as Loans and deposits from credit institutions and Deposits from customers, \\r\\nwhich are not on demand, have been estimated based on the discounted cash flow model using interest rates for similar products as \\r\\nat year end.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by IFRS 8. In Luminor, the CODM has been defined as Group Executive Management. The \\r\\nExecutive Management Committee monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions \\r\\nabout resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss and is \\r\\nmeasured consistently with operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of \\r\\nexpenses after internal funds transfer pricing, as management primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a \\r\\nperformance measure. Fees & commission income for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made \\r\\nbetween different product categories for segment reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments (including \\r\\ninternal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Other segment) and income and expenses not booked on \\r\\ncustomer level, which are allocated between the operating segments. Only assets and liabilities relating to customers who belong to \\r\\nthe operating segments are reported under the respective segments, all other balance sheet items are reported under Other segment. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 39  \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 March 2019, as part of implementing new operating model, Luminor Group implemented new reportable operating segments, \\r\\ntherefore previous periods data is not fully comparable in respective segments. Results from 1 January 2019 to 28 February 2019 \\r\\nwere adjusted to reflect the new operating segments. \\r\\n\\r\\nREPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth Management. \\r\\nThe segment reporting is based on a combination of organizational structure and customer service model. \\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate Banking segment services business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager. Retail Banking segment services \\r\\nbusiness customers without a dedicated relationship manager and private individuals not belonging to Wealth Management segment. \\r\\nWealth Management services wealthy private individuals and holding companies associated with those individuals. Results of other \\r\\noperating segments below the quantitative thresholds set in IFRS 8 which are not allocated to main business segments are included \\r\\nin Other segment. \\r\\n\\r\\n Corporate \\r\\n\\r\\nBanking \\r\\nRetail Banking \\r\\n\\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement \\r\\nOther Total \\r\\n\\r\\nQ1 2019      \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 31 022 30 341 1 997 2 620 65 980 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet fees & commission income 6 688 10 906 531 588 18 714 \\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income 2 932 1 465 96 443 4 936 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther income 32 488 0 2 122 2 642 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal income 40 675 43 200 2 623 5 773 92 272 \\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel costs  administrative costs and \\r\\n\\r\\ndepreciation  \\r\\n\\r\\n-23 006 -43 668 -1 678 696 -67 657 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (losses/ reversal) on loans \\r\\n\\r\\nto customers \\r\\n\\r\\n474 7 086 39 -114 7 485 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther 0 0 0 -4 090 -4 090 \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit before Tax 18 142 6 618 985 2 265 28 010 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\n31.03.2019      \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets      \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 5 122 348 6 254 798 90 448 -184 806 11 282 787 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  5 122 348 6 254 798 90 448 -184 806 11 282 787 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities      \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 4 896 221 3 640 005 848 407 4 085 9 388 718 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  4 896 221 3 640 005 848 407 4 085 9 388 718 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 40  \\r\\n\\r\\n Corporate \\r\\n\\r\\nBanking \\r\\nRetail Banking \\r\\n\\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement \\r\\nOther Total \\r\\n\\r\\nQ1 2018      \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 32 874 29 291 1 555 3 046 66 766 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet fees & commission income 7 289 11 511 524 928 20 252 \\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income 2 418 1 389 61 532 4 401 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther income 213 274 0 1 098 1 585 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal income 42 794 42 465 2 141 5 605 93 004 \\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel costs  administrative costs and \\r\\n\\r\\ndepreciation  \\r\\n\\r\\n-16 659 -33 547 -1 330 -5 285 -56 822 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (losses/ reversal) on loans \\r\\n\\r\\nto customers \\r\\n\\r\\n-4 185 1 169 -2 2 310 -709 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther 0 0 0 -1 193 -1 193 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating profit 21 949 10 087 808 1 436 34 280 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018      \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets      \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 5 270 357 6 296 954 92 801 -187 974 11 472 138 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  5 270 357 6 296 954 92 801 -187 974 11 472 138 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities      \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 4 783 549 3 559 706 722 684 3 946 9 069 885 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  4 783 549 3 559 706 722 684 3 946 9 069 885 \\r\\n\\r\\n17. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s shareholders made a decision on 28 May 2019 to carry out a bonus share issue, followed by a reduction of share capital. \\r\\nThe bonus share issue is based on the bank’s interim balance sheet as of January 2, 2019 and involves a partial conversion of share \\r\\npremium in the amount of EUR 216,030,920 into share capital. Following the bonus issue, the share capital of the bank shall be \\r\\nreduced by the same amount and is subject to pay-out to the shareholder after the expiry of a statutory waiting period of at least \\r\\nthree months. The pending reduction will be fully taken into account when calculating capital ratios after the decision date.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the pay-out Luminor will continue to be capitalized above all regulatory requirements and the internal targets.  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 41  \\r\\n\\r\\nCONTACT DETAILS \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS \\r\\n\\r\\nLocation and address Liivalaia 45 \\r\\n\\r\\n10145 Tallinn  \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nMain activity: \\r\\n\\r\\nCommercial Register code \\r\\n\\r\\nTelephone \\r\\n\\r\\nFax \\r\\n\\r\\nNordea SWIFT/BIC \\r\\n\\r\\nDNB SWIFT/BIC \\r\\n\\r\\nWebsite \\r\\n\\r\\nE-mail \\r\\n\\r\\nBalance sheet date \\r\\n\\r\\nReporting period  \\r\\n\\r\\nReporting currency \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Estonia \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit institution \\r\\n\\r\\n11315936 \\r\\n\\r\\n+372 628 3300 \\r\\n\\r\\n+372 628 3201 \\r\\n\\r\\nNDEAEE2X \\r\\n\\r\\nRIKOEE22 \\r\\n\\r\\nwww.luminor.ee \\r\\n\\r\\ninfo@luminor.ee \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n01.01.2019 – 31.03.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nEuro \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.luminor.ee/\\r\\nfile://///dnbl.sise/dfs/Shares/books/Reporting/Eesti%20Pank%20Reports/2018/Interim%20Reports_Vahearuanded/Q2/IAS%2034/Interim%20reporting/info@luminor.ee\",\n",

By simplifying our structure and \\r\\nour decision-making process, consolidating our IT, and strengthening our controls, we have become a more efficient organisation. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe gain continuous support from the strong macro conditions and stable operating environment that the Baltic states are enjoying \\r\\nright now, and from the concentrated and regionally harmonising banking market. The Baltic states today are among the most \\r\\ndynamic economies of the European Union, offering exceptionally exciting financial opportunities that are at the same time backed \\r\\nby the security of the euro area.   \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second quarter, the Luminor retail banking team sped up the transformation of the customer service model and opened \\r\\ncustomer service centres operating under a new concept. The efficiency of the pan-Baltic model has also been demonstrated by \\r\\nsuccessful common marketing campaigns and improved management of sales channels, which has helped us to achieve growth of \\r\\n13% in the deposit portfolio over the same period of last year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor corporate banking team has meanwhile overseen the growth of the deposit portfolio of corporate clients for the third \\r\\nquarter in a row, as deposit volumes were 11% larger in the second quarter than in the same period of 2018.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus of the wealth management team on growing the business and increasing customer satisfaction has increased the pension \\r\\nassets under management in the Baltics by 11% and assets under management by 25% from what they were in the second quarter of \\r\\nlast year.   \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have also put in motion the transfer of customer data and services in Latvia and Lithuania to the unified Luminor system, with the \\r\\nfirst customers having been successfully moved to the unified systems. Our digital team is working hard to develop the new Luminor \\r\\ndigital channels and prepare our current channels for the process of transferring customer data. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is continuously committed to preventing money laundering and terrorist financing through the prevention, detection, and \\r\\nreporting of unusual activities, and we have developed and implemented a robust financial crime risk management framework to \\r\\nfulfil this commitment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2018, Blackstone, one of the world’s leading investment funds, signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in \\r\\nLuminor. The process of gaining regulatory approval from the European Central Bank and locally is progressing well and it is expected \\r\\nthat this transaction will be closed during the second half of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has also widened its investor base further, issuing its second public senior unsecured bond of 300 million euros in June, \\r\\ntaking yet another important step towards becoming a self-funded, independent pan-Baltic bank. The bond issue attracted 75 \\r\\nindividual investors from across Europe, of which more than 80% were non-Baltic accounts. The scale of the investors’ interest proves \\r\\nthat Luminor’s financial profile is strong and that Luminor as a credit institution is viewed across a broad European investor universe \\r\\nas a solid and emerging investment case.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is well on track with its transformation programme that will see it grow into a leading independent Baltic financial service \\r\\nprovider that is a partner to companies and to financially active people with an entrepreneurial mind-set. \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n4 \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nOverview \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor (Luminor Bank AS) was established on 1 October 2017 by the merger of the operations in the Baltic states of DNB Bank ASA \\r\\n(Commercial Register no. 984 851 006) and Nordea Bank AB (currently Nordea Bank Abp, as Nordea has been domiciled in Finland \\r\\nsince 1 October 2018 following the cross-border reversed merger between Nordea Bank AB (publ) and Nordea Bank Abp, registration \\r\\nno. 2858394-9) to create a new-generation financial service provider for local businesses and  financially active people.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with approximately 1 million clients, 2566 employees, and \\r\\nmarket share of 16.4% in deposits and 20.2% in lending as at the end of the second quarter of 2019. Total shareholders’ equity \\r\\namounts to EUR 1.6 billion and Luminor is capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 18%. Luminor’s vision is to become the best financial \\r\\necosystem for its customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn agreement was signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank AB  and the US-based private equity firm \\r\\nBlackstone to sell a majority stake in Luminor. As part of the transaction, Blackstone will acquire a 60% majority stake in the bank. \\r\\nNordea and DNB will retain equal 20% equity stakes in Luminor and will continue to support the bank with long-term funding, \\r\\nexpertise, and ongoing representation on the Supervisory Council. Additionally, Blackstone has entered into an agreement with \\r\\nNordea to purchase their remaining 20% stake over the coming years. Closing of the transaction is subject to the approval of the \\r\\nEuropean Central Bank and local supervisory authorities and is expected to occur in the second half of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers a wide range of products and services to its customers through all possible channels, digital and physical, with 38 \\r\\ncustomer service centres and four meet-up points in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia combined.

This has left a notable mark on \\r\\nthe protracted soft patch in the global manufacturing sector and continues to depress economic sentiment. Manufacturing confidence \\r\\nin particular has been affected the most, with weakness expected to extend into the second half of the year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic states, together with some CEE peers like Slovakia, are today among the most dynamic economies of the EU. During the \\r\\nlast two years the economies of the euro area, including those of the Baltic states, have enjoyed a strong and broadly based recovery \\r\\nreflected in above-trend growth and tightening labour markets. The average yearly growth rate for 2017-18 exceeded 4% in Estonia \\r\\nand Latvia, and was a robust 3.8% in Lithuania, while the average growth in GDP in the euro area was close to 2%.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth is set to start moderating gradually, albeit from a high level, but labour markets will still be firm and tight even as European \\r\\neconomies go through the current soft patch in the global trade cycle. Growth in GDP in the euro area decelerated noticeably last \\r\\nautumn to only 1.2% year on year and 0.2% over the quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018, as industry and trade made a weaker \\r\\ncontribution. However, the euro area economies managed to resist any further moderation in momentum in the spring with growth \\r\\nin the first quarter slightly exceeding expectations at 1.2% over the year and 0.4% over the quarter. Against this softer external \\r\\nbackdrop the Baltic states have so far resisted the disruptions to global trade and sustained their strong and broadly based economic \\r\\nmomentum in the first quarter, benefiting not least from investments and exports. Estonia posted yearly growth of 4.6% in the first \\r\\nquarter, Latvia of 3.2%, and Lithuania of 3.8%, meaning they remained among the fastest growing economies in the euro area.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe external sector will weigh on growth in the open Baltic economies and it is likely that export revenues will taper until there is a \\r\\nrecovery in global trade and confidence. We expect only a gradual moderation of growth given the continued support from strong \\r\\nlabour markets and healthy domestic demand, which remain the key engines of growth.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite slightly weaker confidence in industry, exports have so far predominantly resisted the weakness in external markets and \\r\\nexpanded at a healthy pace, especially in Estonia and Lithuania. Latvia continues to exceed expectations with strong performance in \\r\\ninvestment, which benefits from EU structural funds and the appetite of industry for investments to enhance productivity. This could \\r\\npartly help to offset the headwinds from slower growth in key trading partners, including the euro area and the Nordic countries. \\r\\nOverall, growth in the Baltic states will continue to be supported by rising wages, fading inflationary pressures and further, albeit \\r\\nslower, gains in employment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nActivities \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor completed its cross-border merger on 2 January 2019 and continues its operations in all the three Baltic states through the \\r\\nbank headquartered in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all the assets, rights and \\r\\nliabilities of Luminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank \\r\\ncontinues its activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches. A new organisational set up and a new \\r\\ngovernance structure were also introduced, and new members of management bodies were appointed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe deposits and financial instruments of the depositors and customers who use the investment services of Luminor Bank AS Latvian \\r\\nbranch and Luminor Bank AS Lithuanian branch are guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and investor protection scheme established \\r\\nand operated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to roll out the new operating model during the second quarter by simplifying its structure and decision-making \\r\\nprocess, unifying and executing IT consolidation, strengthening its controls, and becoming more efficient, more resilient and more \\r\\nresolvable. These developments meant the Luminor team was reduced by some 200 employees during the second quarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second quarter Luminor started transfering customer data and services to the unified Luminor system in Latvia and Lithuania. \\r\\nThe first customers have been moved successfully to the unified systems, and this work will continue until the end of the year. The \\r\\ndigital team continued their efforts in developing the new Luminor digital channels and preparing our current channels for the process \\r\\nof transferring customer data. The main purpose of this process is to offer similar functionality to those customers who are transferred, \\r\\nand to secure smooth and uninterrupted services for the customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n6 \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was announced that Luminor will disable access to digital channels using code cards from 10 September. Customers are encouraged \\r\\nto use modern digital authorisation tools instead and are offered help in starting to use them.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team carried out a solid transformation in its distribution channels in the second quarter and improved efficiency in \\r\\nrelated areas. Ten locations in the customer service network were closed, and two others were transformed into meet-up points. \\r\\nLuminor continued to roll out its new customer service model and opened new concept customer service centres in Riga and Tallinn. \\r\\nAt the end of the second quarter, Luminor was able to serve its customers in a total of 42 locations across the Baltics.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCashless solutions were introduced in customer centres for Lithuania and Estonia during the reporting period, as the process of \\r\\nautomating cash handling was implemented in Lithuania, and it is planned that the solution will be expanded to Estonia during the next \\r\\nquarter. The centralisation of consumer lending was completed during the period, so the bank now has a unified approach to consumer \\r\\nlending products, their terms and conditions, and lending procedures for its customers in all the Baltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBy running pan-Baltic sales and marketing campaigns and improving management of sales channels, the retail banking team has \\r\\nsucceeded in growing the deposit portfolio by 13% from the same quarter of last year. The new lending volumes for retail customers \\r\\nremained stable during the quarter.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe migration of the first pilot group of customers to the unified bank platform has been completed in Latvia and Lithuania. The change \\r\\nfrom code cards to other authorisation tools has been rolled out and at the end of the second quarter, 45% of internet bank sign-in \\r\\nsessions were ensured by Smart-ID authorisation. Increasing the use of this tool remains the top priority, as it is one of the fundamental \\r\\nfactors for successful sales through remote channels in the rest of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second quarter of 2019 the Corporate Banking team continued to focus on increasing the profitability of our corporate lending \\r\\nportfolio. This led to a reduction of 10% in outstanding loan volumes from the second quarter of 2018. The growth of the deposit \\r\\nportfolio of corporate clients maintained its pace for the third quarter in a row, and deposit volumes were 11% larger in the second \\r\\nquarter of 2019 than in the same quarter of 2018.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoan loss provisions increased to EUR 11.6m in the second quarter as the outlook worsened for Latvia’s subsidised energy sector and \\r\\nbecause of additional provisions in the Estonian NPL book. The macro environment continues to be very supportive. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new operating model and the latest developments in the banking market were presented to corporate clients at a series of \\r\\ncorporate banking events across all the Baltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main focus in Wealth Management in the second quarter was on growing the business, ensuring high customer satisfaction and \\r\\nexecuting changes in the Pan-Baltic operating model. Collaboration with other business segments supported both growth and customer \\r\\nsatisfaction.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second half of May, functional managers were selected and appointed for the Asset Management & Pension team. The orderly \\r\\ntransfer of responsibilities will be orchestrated by the end of the third quarter with the reappointment of memberships of local \\r\\nmanagement boards of pension companies and in consultation with local supervising authorities.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pension assets under management in the Baltics reached EUR 1.32 billion in the second quarter of 2019, up 11% on the same \\r\\nquarter of 2018. Luminor had 292 thousand second pillar and 62 thousand third pillar pension customers at the end of the quarter.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking focuses on growing the assets under management and ensuring a high level of customer satisfaction by helping affluent \\r\\nand high net worth individuals and their families to grow, manage and preserve their wealth. During the quarter the Private Banking \\r\\nteam focused on attracting new customers from the market. Collaboration and information-sharing with Luminor’s other business \\r\\nsegments helped to deliver the results. In the second quarter of 2019, there was 25% more in assets under management than in the \\r\\nsame quarter of 2018.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor aims to become the financial partner in the Baltics for the local way of living and doing business. An important part of achieving \\r\\nthis is to take account of corporate governance, social conditions and the environment in all the bank’s activities.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe stand for sustainability, diversity and equal rights. Luminor is not party to any infringement of human or labour rights, corruption, \\r\\nenvironmental harm or other actions that could be regarded as unethical.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are accountable to society and the environment and we expect the same from our partners, having included our Rules of Social \\r\\nResponsibility as part of all our Cooperation Agreements.  \\r\\n\\r\\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORTS \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor does not tolerate money laundering, financing of terrorism or any other financial crimes. Luminor has developed and \\r\\nimplemented a robust financial crime risk management framework to prevent, detect, manage and report financial crime risk \\r\\neffectively. The framework consists of financial crime detection technology, comprehensive policies and procedures, regular risk \\r\\nassessments, training and awareness-raising, and ongoing monitoring of new and developing financial crime risks. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor complies with all applicable legislation on anti-money laundering, combating terrorist financing and sanctions. In addition, \\r\\nLuminor follows and implements international guidelines, recommendations and standards issued by the regulatory and supervisory \\r\\nauthorities, relevant international bodies, local banking associations and financial intelligence units in each Baltic state. Luminor \\r\\ncontinuously invests in its systems and improves its processes to combat financial crime in a constantly changing environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor primarily serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers with a strong personal or business connection to the \\r\\nBaltic states. As such, Luminor’s risk appetite statements reflect the need for full transparency of the background of Luminor customers, \\r\\nthe availability of KYC data, and the economic rationale for the activities of customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supervisory Council of Luminor approved the AML/CFT Standards, Sanctions Standards and Risk Appetite Statements that define: \\r\\n\\r\\n- Absolute limitations, where Luminor will not under any conditions establish a relationship with the customer;\\r\\n\\r\\n- Conditional risk limitations subject to authorised approval, where Luminor will only establish and retain a relationship with\\r\\nthe customer if it is reviewed and approved by the designated Customer Risk Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 140 professionals in Luminor’s Compliance Division and Customer Data Quality Middle Office maintain and ensure a robust \\r\\ncompliance framework and processes throughout the organisation. More than 15 professionals are internationally certified AML \\r\\nspecialists (CAMS), Certified Fraud Examiners (CFE), Certified Internal Auditors (CIA) and certified Compliance Officers. \\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 80 internal training and awareness-raising events were organised in the first half of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 30 JUNE 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Shareholders’ Meeting of Luminor Bank AS accepted the requests of Nadine Faruque and Ari Kaperi to resign from the bank’s  \\r\\nSupervisory Council. The resignation of Ari Kaperi is effective as of 1 July 2019 and the resignation of Nadine Faruque is effective as of 11 \\r\\nJuly 2019 (see Note 17). \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 July 2019, Luminor sold its property holding company SIA Skanstes 12 (Latvia) to the investment company Colonna. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n8 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Results \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter completing its cross-border merger at the beginning of the year, Luminor continues its operations in all the Baltic states through \\r\\nthe Estonian registered bank Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. Luminor has entered the next phase of its \\r\\ntransformation and changed its operating model starting from 1 March. By consolidating its technological platforms, right-sizing the \\r\\nbusiness, simplifying the product and service portfolio and increasing efficiency, the bank aims to accelerate the transformation to \\r\\nbuilding and executing areas of superior customer experience. As a consequence of this process, the financial results of Luminor are \\r\\naffected by the exceptional and restructuring costs of investing in technology and reducing team sizes. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second quarter net profit reached EUR 6.7 million and was EUR 36.9 million lower than in the same period of 2018. Net interest \\r\\nincome declined by 0.4%, while net loans declined by 6.5% as a result of planned activities that aim to ensure fair and rational pricing \\r\\nof risk, and to improve profitability. The change in financing volumes has also affected net fee and commission income, which was \\r\\n3.5% lower than in the second quarter of last year. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses in the second quarter were EUR 68.7 million and were EUR 14.4 million higher than in the same quarter of \\r\\nlast year. Like in the first quarter, operating expenses were mainly driven by transformation costs and net impairment on loans to \\r\\ncustomers. Exceptional expenses were EUR 0.9 million higher than in the first quarter and reached EUR 18.1 million, the major part \\r\\nof which were IT expenses, accounting for 85%, followed by staff expenses with 5% and other transformation costs with 10%. \\r\\nImpairment of loans to customers and other assets during the second quarter reached EUR 12.3 million as a result of changed \\r\\nassumptions used in the quarterly loan assessment process. Impairment was driven by large exposures in the legacy portfolio, while \\r\\nthe credit quality of new lending remains good and is facilitated by the current macroeconomic outlook. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe funding position continued to improve during the second quarter. The loan-to-deposit ratio improved to 117.1% from 142.7% a \\r\\nyear ago. The improved funding gap was supported by a reduction in loans of EUR 769 million and an increase in deposits of EUR 1.1 \\r\\nbillion over the past 12 months.

This reduction came from write-offs, repayments, and loans returning to \\r\\nperforming.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe allowances for on-balance sheet exposures amounted to EUR 174.7 million or 1.6% of the total loan portfolio, which was up EUR \\r\\n1.5 million on the previous quarter. The effect comes from a decrease of EUR 2.0 million in allowances for performing (Stage 1 and \\r\\nStage 2) loans and an increase of EUR 3.5 million in allowances for impaired (Stage 3) loans, which is mainly impacted by one customer \\r\\nin Estonia. The level of allowances on the impaired loans was 28.4% at the end of second quarter of 2019, which was 3.3 pp higher \\r\\nthan in the previous quarter because of a reduction in the impaired loans

Deposits from customers are the main source of funding \\r\\nfor Luminor and make up EUR 9.3 billion or 66.9% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity at the end of the second quarter of 2019. \\r\\nThe fundingbase is predominantly EUR-denominated. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the deposits, Luminor also has outstanding debt securities and funding from parent banks constituting a substantional \\r\\npart of the funding base. On 11 June 2019, Luminor Bank AS issued three-year and four-month public senior unsecured preferred \\r\\nbonds worth EUR 300 million under the European Medium Term Note (EMTN) Programme. The bonds are listed on the Euronext \\r\\nStock Exchange. Appetite from investors was very strong, generating orders in excess of EUR 600 million that enabled Luminor to \\r\\nissue bonds worth EUR 300 million at a spread over mid-swap of 167 bps, tightening pricing by 13 bps from initial pricing indications. \\r\\nGiven the low euro interest rates, the final coupon rate of the bonds was fixed at 1.375% and the yield ended at 1.42%. More than \\r\\n80% of orders, worth nearly EUR 500 million, originated from outside the Baltics. As at Q2 2019 the bonds outstanding under the \\r\\nEMTN programme amount to a total of EUR 650 million, with the transaction of 11 June 2019 building on the inaugural transaction \\r\\nof EUR 350 million from October 2018. The Senior Unsecured Medium-Term Note Program is assigned a rating of Baa2 by Moody’s. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at the end of the second quarter of 2019, funding from parents amounted to EUR 1,838 million and was provided by the two parent \\r\\nbanks in the form of a syndicate, where each parent bank provides 50%. Long-term funding is committed for 6 years (4+2) starting \\r\\nfrom 1 October 2017, when Luminor was established. Short-term funding is in the form of revolving credit of 364 days. In addition to \\r\\nthe outstanding funding utilised, there is also a committed unused credit line of EUR 2,366 million in place. EUR 300 million of parent \\r\\nfunding was amortised in June after the senior unsecured issuance under the European Medium Term Note (EMTN) Programme.  \\r\\n\\r\\nRating \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, \\r\\nwith a stable outlook. There has been no changes to Luminor’s ratings. \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor uses different metrics to measure liquidity risk. One metric used is the LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio). The LCR for Luminor \\r\\nwas 132.5% as at the end of the second quarter by the CRR LCR definition. The liquidity buffer is composed of highly liquid central \\r\\nbank eligible securities and cash.

Following the bonus issue, the share capital of the bank was reduced \\r\\nby the same amount. Pay-out to the shareholder is subject to the expiry of a statutory waiting period of at least three months. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continues to have a strong capitalization that is sufficient to ensure the financial stability of the Group and supply the capital \\r\\nneeded to deliver the business strategy. The Total Capital Ratio of Luminor was 18.0% as at the end of the second quarter of 2019 \\r\\n(following the capital reduction), which is comfortably above the internal target of 17.0%. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Total Capital Ratio is fully covered by Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Luminor uses the Standardised method in the Capital \\r\\nAdequacy calculations to calculate credit and market risk. Operational risk is calculated using the Basic Indicator Approach method.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2019, the Leverage Ratio, calculated using CRR, was 10.6%, and it was 12.0% at the end of the first \\r\\nquarter of 2019. The Leverage Ratio is calculated as the bank’s total Tier 1 own funds divided by its total risk exposure measure, \\r\\nincluding the risk positions on assets and off balance sheet liabilities. \\r\\n\\r\\n1.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n96.9%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.6% 1.9%\\r\\n\\r\\n96.1%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.0% 0.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n96.6%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.9%1.1%\\r\\n\\r\\n96.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.1%\\r\\n\\r\\nBaltic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania Other EU Non-EU \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n16 \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital ratios \\r\\n\\r\\nPosition  Q2 2019 Q1 2019 Q4 2018* Q3 2018* Q2 2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital adequacy 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% 17.58% \\r\\n\\r\\nLeverage Ratio 10.59% 12.00% 10.38% 10.68% 10.84% \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 Ratio 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% 17.58% \\r\\n\\r\\nT1 Capital Ratio 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% 17.58% \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Capital Ratio 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% 17.58% \\r\\n\\r\\n* Luminor Group AB consolidated figures \\r\\n\\r\\nOwn funds requirements \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR 30 June 2019 31 December 2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nTOTAL RISK EXPOSURE AMOUNT 8 668 797 9 206 164 \\r\\n\\r\\n1.

The condensed consolidated interim financial information \\r\\ndoes not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction \\r\\nwith the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2018. As described in the section Accounting \\r\\nfor the merger below, following the merger on 02 January 2019, the condensed consolidated interim financial information includes \\r\\nthe financial information for 3 merged banks, therefore for the purpose of obtaining annual financial information for the same group \\r\\nof entities, we advise the reader to also refer to the consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\nof Luminor Bank AS’s parent entity, Luminor Group AB (holding), available at https://www.luminor.ee/en/financial-reports. Those \\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.luminor.ee/en/financial-reports\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n25 \\r\\n\\r\\nconsolidated financial statements represent substantially the financial position and results of the 3 merged banks, with certain minor \\r\\nadditional balances and transactions from Luminor Group AB (holding) entity. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are consistent with \\r\\nthose followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, except \\r\\nfor the additional policy for accounting for the merger, and adoption of new and amended standards as set out below. \\r\\n\\r\\nACCOUNTING FOR THE MERGER \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS do not prescribe method of accounting for transactions under common control. Pursuant to IAS 8, management has determined \\r\\nthat the merger is accounted for using the predecessor method of accounting. Under this method the financial statements are \\r\\npresented as if the businesses had been combined from the beginning of the earliest period presented (or the date that the entities \\r\\nwere brought under common control, if later). The assets and liabilities of the banks transferred under common control are recognised \\r\\nat their predecessor values, i.e at their carrying values from the financial statements at the highest level of consolidation (i.e. Luminor \\r\\nGroup AB (holding)). No new goodwill arises under predecessor method. Any difference between the consideration given and the \\r\\naggregate book value of the assets and liabilities (as of the date of the transaction) of the acquired entity is included in equity. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the completion of the merger on 02 January 2019, all assets and liabilities of Luminor Bank AS, Luminor Bank Latvia and Luminor \\r\\nBank Lithuania have been combined with the retrosepective effect. Therefore, 2018 comparatives in this condensed consolidated \\r\\ninterim financial information of Luminor Bank AS include also the financial results of the Luminor Bank Latvia and Luminor Bank \\r\\nLithuania in accordance with the policy described above.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThis note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on the Group’s financial statements and discloses the new accounting \\r\\npolicies that have been applied from 1 January 2019 below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 “Leases” was issued on 13 January 2016 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The new \\r\\nstandard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. All leases result in the lessee \\r\\nobtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and, if lease payments are made over time, also obtaining financing. \\r\\nAccordingly, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases as was required by IAS 17 and, \\r\\ninstead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Lessees are required to recognize: (a) assets and liabilities for all leases with a \\r\\nterm of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value; and (b) using depreciation of lease assets separately from \\r\\ninterest on lease liabilities in the income statement. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS \\r\\n17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases and account for those two types of leases \\r\\ndifferently.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 \\r\\nmonths or less and do not contain a purchase option (‘short-term leases’), and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low \\r\\nvalue (‘low-value assets’). \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustments recognised on adoption of IFRS 16 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group decided that it will apply the standard using the modified retrospective method and has not restated comparatives for the \\r\\n2018 reporting period. The Group recognized a right of use asset of 30 623 thousand Euro against a corresponding lease liability in \\r\\nthe amount of 33 207 thousand Euro and the impact to the equity as of 1 January 2019 amounts to 2 584 thousand Euro, decreasing \\r\\nits balance. Net impact on equity was caused by the fact that the Group decided to recognise the right-of-use assets at the date of \\r\\ninitial application, measuring them at their carrying amount as if the standard had been applied since the commencement date, but \\r\\ndiscounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n26 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease liabilities as at 1 January 2019 are reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of 31 December 2018 as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating lease commitments disclosed as at 31 December 2018   36 656 \\r\\n\\r\\nWeighted average incremental borrowing rate as at 1 January 2019 2,45% \\r\\n\\r\\nDiscounted operating lease commitments at 1 January 2019 31 847 \\r\\n\\r\\nLess \\r\\n\\r\\nCommitments relating short-term leases  158 \\r\\n\\r\\nAdd \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustment as a result of a different treatment of extension and termination options 1 518 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal lease liability recognized as at 1 January 2019 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nOf which are:  \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent lease liabilities  4 201 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-current lease liabilities  29 006 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe associated right-of-use assets for property leases were measured on a retrospective basis as if the new rules had always been \\r\\napplied. Other right-of use assets were measured at the amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid \\r\\nor accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe recognised right-of-use assets relate to the following types of assets (TEUR):  \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR 31 December 2018  1 January 2019 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nProperties 0 30 529 42 178 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther assets 0 164 87 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal right-of-use assets 0 30 693 42 265 \\r\\n\\r\\nProperty, plant and equipment 16 383 16 383 15 791 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Property, plant and equipment  16 383 47 076   58 056  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe change in accounting policy affected the following items in the balance sheet on 1 January 2019 (TEUR): \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 property, plant and equipment – increase by 30 257 TEUR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 lease liabilities – increase by 33 207 TEUR \\r\\n\\r\\nThe net impact on retained earnings on 1 January 2019 was a decrease of 2 584 TEUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognised rent expense from short-term leases, leases of low-value assets and variable lease payments of totally 740 \\r\\nthousand Euros for the 6 months ended 30 June 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nPractical expedients applied \\r\\n\\r\\nIn applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n27 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 January 2019 as short-term \\r\\nleases; \\r\\n\\r\\nexcluding initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset, and  \\r\\n\\r\\nusing hindsight, eg in determining the lease term where the contract includes extension or termination options. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s leasing activities and how these are accounted for \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group leases various offices and other assets (IT equipment and cars). Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 4 \\r\\nto15 years but may have extension options as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide \\r\\nrange of different terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 2018 financial year, leases of property, IT equipment and cars were classified as either finance or operating leases. Payments \\r\\nmade under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) were charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis \\r\\nover the period of the lease.   \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 January 2019, leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset \\r\\nis available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged \\r\\nto profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for \\r\\neach period.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees\\r\\n\\r\\n(d) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option,and\\r\\n\\r\\n(e) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s \\r\\nincremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset \\r\\nof similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo determine incremental borrowing rate we have considered: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. existing borrowings (own funding cost) that need to be adjusted for amount, security, term etc. and\\r\\n2. property yield that need to be adjusted for term, amount, quality of property, potential weighted average cost of capital \\r\\n\\r\\n(WACC) element in yields etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor property leases the Bank has decided the usage of the Bank’s own funding cost as a discount rate. For other assets the Bank uses \\r\\nthe interest rate implicit in the lease as discount rate, as it is readily determinable. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the Bank measured the lease liability by: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications (like changes in lease term, in the assessment\\r\\nof an option to purchase the underlying asset, in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, in future \\r\\nlease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, including for example a change to\\r\\nreflect changes in market rental rates following a market rent review and in floating interest rates, or to reflect revised in-substance \\r\\nfixed lease payments (payments are structured as variable lease payments, but there is no genuine variability in those payments and\\r\\nthose payments contain variable clauses that do not have real economic substance).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n28 \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost of the right-of-use asset comprises: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that\\r\\ndate;\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and\\r\\n\\r\\n(d) an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it\\r\\nis located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are\\r\\nincurred to produce inventories. The lessee incurs the obligation for those costs either at the commencement date or as a \\r\\nconsequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses; and\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications, or to \\r\\nreflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in \\r\\nprofit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment and small \\r\\nitems of office furniture below 5 000 EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These terms are \\r\\nused to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. The majority of extension and termination options held are \\r\\nexercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn determining the lease term, the management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise \\r\\nan extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included \\r\\nin the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated) and based on the assessment performed, the \\r\\npotential impact is immaterial. \\r\\n\\r\\nMOVEMENTS OF THE GROUP'S RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES  \\r\\n\\r\\nSet out below, are the carrying amounts of the Group’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and the movements during the period: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR  1 January 2019 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nRight-of-use assets 30 693 42 265 \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liability 31 847 44 961  \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in total right-of use assets and lease liability is primarily caused by prolonging one existing lease contract, without increasing \\r\\nor decreasing the scope of the lease. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n29 \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, and the \\r\\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are \\r\\nbased on management’s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable \\r\\nunder the circumstances. Management also makes certain judgements, apart from those involving estimations, in the process of \\r\\napplying the accounting policies. Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated \\r\\nfinancial statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the \\r\\nnext financial year include: \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognizes the credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The Standard applies a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) \\r\\napproach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held \\r\\nat FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The assets to test for impairment are divided into three \\r\\ngroups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes assets where there has been no significant increase in credit \\r\\nrisk since initial recognition. In stage 1, the allowances equal the 12-month expected credit loss. Stage 2 includes assets where there \\r\\nhas been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets. In stage 2 and 3, the allowances equal the lifetime \\r\\nexpected credit losses. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for additional category - purchased \\r\\nor originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) - regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable \\r\\ninputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include \\r\\n(no major changes comparing to the model applied in calculating the year-end balances) : \\r\\n\\r\\nevaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2; \\r\\n\\r\\nidentification of unlikely to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3; \\r\\n\\r\\nassessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including the \\r\\nvarious formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\r\\nthe modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) \\r\\nand exposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\r\\ndetermining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model; \\r\\n\\r\\nestimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic and \\r\\npessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;  \\r\\n\\r\\nestimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and assigning \\r\\nprobabilities to those scenarios; \\r\\n\\r\\n setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlease refer to Note 12. \\r\\n\\r\\n3.

The swaps are being used to \\r\\nhedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of its fixed rate senior unsecured bonds. Trade date for EUR 200 million and EUR 150 \\r\\nmillion interest swap agreements is 10 October 2018, effective date is 18 October 2018 and maturity date is 18 October 2021. For \\r\\nEUR 300 million interest swap agreement trade date is 11 June 2019, effective date is 21 June 2019 and maturity date 21 October \\r\\n2022. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instruments as the terms of the interest rate swaps \\r\\nmatch the terms of the fixed rate loan (i.e. notional amount maturity payment and reset dates). The Group has established a hedge \\r\\nratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships, as the underlying risk of the interest rate swaps is identical to the hedged risk component. \\r\\nTo test hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the \\r\\nhedging instrument against the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nHedge ineffectiveness can theoretically arise from: \\r\\n\\r\\nA different interest rate curve applied to discount the hedged item and hedging instrument \\r\\n\\r\\nDifferences in the timing of cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument, also a different day count \\r\\n\\r\\nThe counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instrument and hedged \\r\\nitem. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n35 \\r\\n\\r\\n30.06.2019 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 650 000 5 921 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial during first half year 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 350 000 1 128 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial during 2018.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where \\r\\nthe fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active \\r\\nmarkets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs to \\r\\nthese models are derived from observable market data where possible, but where observable market data is not available, judgment \\r\\nis required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements mentioned techniques were not used extensively \\r\\nas no such financial assets and financial liabilities exist on the statement of financial position of the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n40 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of loans to customers, customer deposits, amounts due from credit institutions and amounts due to credit institutions \\r\\nand other financial assets and liabilities’ obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the rates \\r\\ncurrently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn assessing the fair value for financial assets, the management has performed a discounted cash flow analysis; up-to-date market \\r\\ninformation at the assessment moment is being used for assessing cash flows. For loans where base interest rates are pegged to \\r\\nfloating market interest rates, the Group has considered the difference between the average interest margin of issued loans and the \\r\\naverage interest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has been changed (increased) \\r\\nsince issuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal to the fair value. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of financial liabilities at amortized cost such as Loans and deposits from credit institutions and Deposits from customers, \\r\\nwhich are not on demand, have been estimated based on the discounted cash flow model using interest rates for similar products as \\r\\nat year end. The fair value of those financial liabilities that are on demand or have a floating interest rate has been estimated to be \\r\\napproximately equal to it’s carrying amount. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTIZED COST \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR \\r\\nCarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n30.06.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value  \\r\\n\\r\\n30.06.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value  \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortized cost \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and Balances with Central banks 2 485 346   2 485 346   3 293 090   3 293 090   \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 150 727 150 727 185 346 185 346 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 10 979 181 10 990 807 11 472 138 11 484 286 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 13 615 254 13 615 254 14 950 574 14 962 722 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\n\\r\\ninstitutions  \\r\\n1 945 912 1 929 640 3 939 396 3 906 454 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 9 374 812 9 404 300 9 069 885 9 098 414 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 651 204 651 204 351 235 351 235 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 259 401   259 401   27 914  27 914  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 12 231 329 12 231 329 13 388 430 13 384 017 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarizes the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. Financial \\r\\ninstruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value: \\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or \\r\\nindirectly observable. \\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input is significant to the fair value measurement is \\r\\nunobservable. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of all Group’s contracted derivatives is defined as level 2. These are interest rate swaps and other derivatives and in all \\r\\ncases pricing is based on market observable inputs. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no movements of financial instruments between the levels during 01.01-30.06.2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n41 \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 30 June 2019 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using  \\r\\n\\r\\n(T EUR)  \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in active \\r\\n\\r\\nmarkets (Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\n\\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\n\\r\\nunobservable inputs \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 3) \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and Balances with Central banks 2 485 346   0 0 2 485 346   \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 112 121 38 606 0 150 727 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 10 979 181 10 979 181 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 5 834 0 0 5 834 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\n\\r\\nprofit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 3 842 0 3 842 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 116 604 42 717 0 159 321 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 53 318 0 53 318 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\n\\r\\nother comprehensive income \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 9 826 9 826 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 1 877 0 0 1 877 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  2 721 782 138 483 10 989 007 13 849 272 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are \\r\\n\\r\\ndisclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 26 067 1 919 845 0 1 945 912 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 7 128 047 2 246 765 9 374 812 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 651 204 0 651 204 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 259 401 259 401 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 50 968 0 50 968 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  26 067 9 750 064 2 506 166 12 282 297 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n42 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 31 December 2018 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using  \\r\\n\\r\\n(T EUR)  \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in active \\r\\n\\r\\nmarkets (Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\n\\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant unobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and Balances with Central banks 3 293 090   0 0 3 293 090   \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 145 451 39 899 0 185 346 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 11 484 286 11 484 286 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 0 1 006 0 1 006 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\n\\r\\nprofit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 83 192 60 566 0 143 758 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 46 664 0 46 664 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\n\\r\\nother comprehensive income \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 1 265 0 0 1 265 \\r\\n\\r\\nShares 0 0 7 607 7 607 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  3 522 998 148 135 11 491 893 15 163 022 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are \\r\\n\\r\\ndisclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\n\\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n22 152 3 917 244 0   3 939 396   \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 7 136 994 1 932 891 9 069 885 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 351 235 0 351 235 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 42 457 0 42 457 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  22 152 11 447 930 1 932 891 13 402 973 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash balances with central banks – very liquid and short-term, so the fair value equals to their carrying amount as the \\r\\n\\r\\nassets can be realized at same price in an orderly transaction \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions – very liquid and short-term, so the fair value equals to their carrying amount as the assets \\r\\n\\r\\ncan be realized at same price in an orderly transaction \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n43 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments - fair value for this kind of instruments is calculated using discounted cash flow method through \\r\\n\\r\\nwhich net present value (NPV) is obtained. Independently sourced market parameters – mainly zero coupon yield curves with \\r\\n\\r\\ndifferent characteristics – are used to get discount factors.  To some derivatives hedge accounting rules are applicable.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss (Pension Funds) - The value date method is used in the acquisition of pension \\r\\n\\r\\nfund units managed by Luminor Pensions Estonia AS and they are initially recognised at acquisition cost, which is the fair value \\r\\n\\r\\npaid for them. Investments into pension fund units have quoted prices from the market, however the market is inactive and \\r\\n\\r\\ntherefore these are classified as level 2 investments. Information about the NAV of pension funds is made publicly available by \\r\\n\\r\\nthe funds on a daily basis; investments of the managed funds subject for NAV accounting are all categorized as Level 1 \\r\\n\\r\\nInstruments. \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers – Fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows using the market interest rates \\r\\n\\r\\nprevailing at each year-end. Loans are issued on market conditions; For loans, where base interest rates are pegged to floating \\r\\n\\r\\nmarket interest rates, the Group has considered difference between average interest margin of issued loans and average \\r\\n\\r\\ninterest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has been changed (increased) since \\r\\n\\r\\nissuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal to fair value. \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions- pricing is under market conditions; fair value of deposits do not differ from the \\r\\n\\r\\ncarrying value.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers- pricing of the deposits is under market conditions, the fair value of deposits has been determined \\r\\n\\r\\nusing the future cashflows, fair value of deposits do not differ from the carrying value. \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued - initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortized costs. \\r\\n\\r\\nBonds are listed but liquidity and market conditions don’t allow using market price as reliable input. Management has \\r\\n\\r\\ndetermined the fair value by discounting the future cash flows, using the market interest yield curve. Additional info in  Note 8 \\r\\n\\r\\nwhere impact from hedge accounting is explained. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income - The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nmeasurement of shares on level 3 (Visa Inc. and Swift shares) are as follows: conversion rate, trading price, liquidity discount. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe management believes that reasonably possible changes to other unobservable inputs would not result in a significant \\r\\n\\r\\nchange in the estimated fair value. Change in fair value of level 3 instruments between 31.12.2018 and 30.06.2019 is due to \\r\\n\\r\\nrevaluation. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value measurement for liabilities is based on the calculation using non observable inputs thus the same categorization as for \\r\\n\\r\\nassets should be applied. \\r\\n\\r\\n20.

SEGMENT REPORTING\\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as Group Executive Management. The Group \\r\\nExecutive Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about \\r\\nresource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit before tax and is measured \\r\\nconsistently with profit before tax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of expenses after internal \\r\\nfunds transfer pricing, as management primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a performance measure. \\r\\nFees & commission income for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made between different product \\r\\ncategories for segment reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments (including \\r\\ninternal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Unallocated segment) and income and expenses not booked \\r\\non customer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using internally agreed allocation keys. Only assets and \\r\\nliabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating segments are reported under the respective segments, all other balance \\r\\nsheet items are reported under Unallocated segment. \\r\\n\\r\\nStarting from 2019, new operating model got implemented in Luminor Group and CODM started monitoring operating segments on \\r\\nthe new basis (as described above). Comparative information was aligned in order to be in compliance with new segmentation \\r\\nprinciples. \\r\\n\\r\\nOPERATING SEGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth Management. \\r\\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. \\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate Banking segment services business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager. Retail Banking segment services \\r\\nbusiness customers without a dedicated relationship manager and private individuals not belonging to Wealth Management segment. \\r\\nWealth Management services wealthy private individuals and holding companies associated with those individuals. Results of other \\r\\noperating segments below the quantitative thresholds set in IFRS 8 which are not allocated to main business segments are included \\r\\nin Unallocated segment.

The transaction, worth 1 billion euros, represents one of the largest \\r\\ninvestments in the Baltic history. \\r\\n\\r\\nNordea Bank Abp and DNB Bank ASA each retain a 20% equity stake in Luminor and will continue to support the bank with long-\\r\\nterm funding, expertise and on-going representation on the Supervisory Council. Blackstone has agreed with Nordea Bank Abp that \\r\\nit will purchase Nordea Bank Abp’s remaining 20% stake over the coming years. \\r\\n\\r\\nBlackstone is one of the world’s leading investment firms and is an ideal partner for Luminor as we undertake one of the most \\r\\nextensive corporate transformations in the Baltics. Blackstone’s proven track record in transformations, strong financial standing \\r\\nand network of global talent will support Luminor as it grows as the largest local independent bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter, Luminor continued to implement the new operating model to become a more efficient, more resilient and \\r\\nmore resolvable organisation. We also progressed further with the separation from the payment infrastructure and information \\r\\nsystems of the parent banks. We finalised the first phase of migration in Latvia and Lithuania, resulting in the successful transfer of \\r\\nnearly 24% of our active legacy Nordea customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to multiple pan-Baltic sales campaigns and improving management of sales channels, the Retail Banking team succeeded in \\r\\nsustaining lending sales volumes and growing the deposit portfolio. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, the Corporate Banking team also succeeded in growing deposit portfolio and continued to focus on increasing the \\r\\nprofitability of our corporate lending portfolio by reducing the portfolio of non-performing loans and transferring services for micro \\r\\nenterprises to the retail banking.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the deposit portfolio grew by 16.7% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pension assets under management in the Baltics reached 1.39 billion euros in the third quarter of 2019, which was 13% more \\r\\nthan in the same quarter of last year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe continue our efforts in averting money laundering and terrorist financing through the prevention, detection, and reporting of \\r\\nunusual activities. At Luminor we are continuously investing in our systems, internal training and awareness raising activities in this \\r\\narea, and we are improving our processes for combating financial crime in a constantly changing environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltics continue to benefit from a strong macroeconomic climate and a stable operating environment, and the region is among \\r\\nthe most economically dynamic in the European Union. Luminor is on track with its transformation and financial plans to grow as a \\r\\nbank dedicated to supporting the sustainable growth of the Baltic region by providing long-term commitment to businesses and \\r\\nindividuals. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\n\\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 4  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nOverview \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (“Luminor”) was established on 1 October 2017 by the merger of the operations in the Baltic states of DNB Bank \\r\\nASA (Commercial Register no. 984 851 006) and Nordea Bank AB (currently Nordea Bank Abp, as Nordea has been domiciled in \\r\\nFinland since 1 October 2018 following the cross-border reversed merger between Nordea Bank AB (publ) and Nordea Bank Abp, \\r\\nregistration no. 2858394-9) to create a new-generation financial service provider for local businesses and financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 it was announced that the transaction signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB Bank ASA and Nordea \\r\\nBank AB and the US-based private equity firm Blackstone had been closed, and as a result a consortium led by private equity funds \\r\\nmanaged by Blackstone acquired a 60% majority stake in the bank. The bank’s initial owners Nordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB \\r\\nBank ASA (\"DNB\") each retained a 20% equity stake in Luminor, but an agreement has been signed by Blackstone and Nordea for \\r\\npurchase of Nordea’s 20% stake over the coming years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with approximately 1 million clients, 2500 employees, and \\r\\nmarket share of 16.8% in deposits and 19.5% in lending as at the end of the third quarter of 2019. Total shareholders’ equity \\r\\namounts to EUR 1.6 billion and Luminor is capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 18.7%. Luminor’s vision is to become the best financial \\r\\necosystem for its customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers a wide range of products and services to its customers through all possible channels, digital and physical, with 36 \\r\\ncustomer service centres, including four meet-up points, in total in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Luminor owns 319 ATMs \\r\\nthroughout the Baltic states, and additionally provides services through 100 ATMs in partnership with other financial services \\r\\nproviders. \\r\\n\\r\\n30 September 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Estonia Latvia Lithuania GroupGr Total  \\r\\n\\r\\nNo of customers ~136 000 ~235 000 ~584 000 ~955 000 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket shares      \\r\\n\\r\\nLending 14.3% 24.4% 21.1% 19.5% \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits 10.7% 17.3% 21.5% 16.8% \\r\\n\\r\\nNo of client service \\r\\ncenters, including \\r\\nmeet- up points \\r\\n\\r\\n8 11 17 36  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of third quarter Luminor had 25 subsidiaries in the Baltics: Luminor Asset Management IPAS (Latvia), Luminor Latvijas \\r\\natklātais pensiju fonds AS (Latvia), UAB Luminor Investiciju valdymas (Lithuania), and Luminor Pensions Estonia AS (Estonia) manage \\r\\npension assets; Recurso UAB (Lithuania), Promano Lit UAB (Lithuania), Industrius UAB (Lithuania), Gėlužės projektai UAB (Latvia), \\r\\nIntractus UAB (Lithuania), Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ (Estonia), Promano Estonia OÜ (Estonia), Luminor Finance SIA (Latvia), Realm SIA \\r\\n(Latvia), Trioleta SIA (Latvia), Baltic ipasums SIA (Latvia), Promano Lat SIA (Latvia),  Salvus SIA (Latvia), Salvus 2 SIA (Latvia), Salvus 3 \\r\\nSIA (Latvia), Salvus 4 SIA (Latvia), and Salvus 6 SIA (Latvia) are asset management companies; Luminor Liising AS (Estonia), Luminor \\r\\nLīzings SIA (Latvia), Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA (Latvia), and Luminor Lizingas UAB (Lithuania) provide leasing services.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 July 2019, Luminor sold its subsidiary property holding company SIA Skanstes 12 (Latvia) to the investment company Colonna.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 September 2019 Ilja Sovetov was appointed as a member of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS by the Supervisory \\r\\nCouncil of Luminor Bank AS. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 September 2019 Luminor Kindlustusmaakler OÜ was merged with Luminor Liising AS.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019, the Shareholders’ Meeting of Luminor Bank AS appointed Nadim El Gabbani, Johan Lilliehöök and Jerome \\r\\nMourgue D\\'Algue as new members of the bank’s Supervisory Council, effective the same day. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 5  \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview  \\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal trade and rising trade barriers are the predominant risks this year, causing heightened financial and economic volatility. Global \\r\\nmanufacturing clearly remains in the epicentre of an economic slowdown, while the consumer is holding strong. Services continue to \\r\\noutperform manufacturing as there has still been only limited spillover from the weakness in manufacturing to the more strongly \\r\\nperforming services sector, which benefits from growth led by domestic demand. The consumer is still showing no signs of retreat in \\r\\nadvanced countries including the Baltic states, and labour markets there actually continue to be tight, though there are early signs of \\r\\nmoderation ahead. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic states, along with Ireland and some CEEC peers like Poland, are today one of the most dynamic economic areas of the EU. \\r\\nThe average growth rate for 2017-18 exceeded 5% in Estonia, with robust yearly growth of 4.7% in Latvia and a bold expansion of \\r\\n3.8% over the year in Lithuania. During the four quarters from the third quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019, GDP growth \\r\\naveraged 1.4% over the year in the euro area at the same time that broad-based, though slowing, yearly growth reached 4.6%  in \\r\\nEstonia, 4.1% in Latvia and 3.7% in Lithuania.   \\r\\n\\r\\nFaced with the external headwinds, growth has started to moderate gradually, albeit from a high level, while labour markets still \\r\\nremain firm and tight as European economies pass through the current soft patch in the global trade cycle. The key export markets \\r\\nfor the Baltics continue on a path of moderate growth, as the euro area, the key destination for Baltic exports, is benefiting from \\r\\ntighter labour markets and support from domestic demand, including new stimulus packages. Euro-area growth is expected to pick \\r\\nup marginally in the years ahead from the current ca 1.2%  over the year pace as the global growth environment and global trade is \\r\\nexpected to gradually recover.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEuro area GDP decelerated noticeably last autumn to only 1.2% year on year and 0.3% over the quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018, \\r\\nwith industry and trade making a softer contribution. Growth remained at 1.2% over the year in the second quarter of 2019, with the \\r\\neconomies that are more open to global trade, including Germany, seeing growth rates fall. Against this external backdrop of \\r\\nweakening growth the Baltic countries have so far largely managed to resist disruptions to trade, and they sustained softer but still \\r\\nquite broadly based economic momentum in the second quarter, benefiting most notably from investment, consumption and \\r\\nhealthy residential construction. Growth over the year in the second quarter was 3.8% in Estonia, 2.9% in Latvia and 3.9% in \\r\\nLithuania, and it remained on a gently moderating path. The balance of risks remains tilted to the downside with risks of a spillover \\r\\nfrom external markets bringing softness to industry and export orders. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe shift from de-synchronised growth to a synchronised moderation of growth is proceeding as expected, and the key risks for the \\r\\nopen Baltic economies emanate from the trade frictions that are hitting advanced countries. A slowdown in global trade remains the \\r\\nroot cause of the weaker outlook for growth and the emerging downside risks for the euro area including the Baltic economies.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe expect the moderation of growth to be only gradual given the continued support from strong labour markets and healthy \\r\\ndomestic demand, which remain the key engines of growth.   \\r\\n\\r\\nActivities \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor completed its cross-border merger on 2 January 2019 and continues its operations in all the three Baltic states through the \\r\\nbank headquartered in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all the assets, rights and \\r\\nliabilities of Luminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank \\r\\ncontinues its activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches. A new organisational set up and a new \\r\\ngovernance structure were also introduced, and new members of the management bodies were appointed. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the cross-border merger, the deposits and holdings in financial instruments of the customers of Luminor Bank AS \\r\\nLatvian branch and Luminor Bank AS Lithuanian branch are guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and investor protection scheme \\r\\nestablished and operated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to roll out the new operating model during the third quarter by simplifying its structure and decision-making \\r\\nprocess, unifying and executing IT consolidation, strengthening its controls, and becoming more efficient, more resilient and more \\r\\nresolvable. These developments meant the Luminor team was reduced by 69 employees during the third quarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter, Luminor continued to cut itself free from the payment infrastructure and information systems of its parent \\r\\nbanks. In July Luminor became independent of SEPA payment flows from the Nordea systems, by routing the payments through the \\r\\nLuminor payment hub that had been established during the reporting period. The first phase of migrating the legacy Nordea \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 6  \\r\\n\\r\\ncustomer base to the Luminor information systems was finalised in Latvia and Lithuania, resulting in the successful transfer of some \\r\\n24% of active customers. The bank has finished separating its leasing, factoring and pension information systems from the Nordea \\r\\nsystems. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 September Luminor disabled access to Luminor digital channels using code cards, which encouraged Lithuanian and Latvian \\r\\nclients to use other means of authentication. Around 500 thousand code-card users were transferred to other authentication tools. \\r\\nBy the end of September, 50% of Luminor internet bank users in Lithuania and Latvia were using Smart-ID as an authentication tool \\r\\nfor accessing the internet bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter Luminor continued to transfer customer data and services to the unified Luminor system in Latvia and Lithuania. \\r\\nThe process of moving customers to the unified systems is going according to the plan and will be finalised in Latvia, Lithuania and \\r\\nEstonia next year. The digital team continued their efforts in developing the new Luminor digital channels and preparing our current \\r\\nchannels for the process of transferring customer data. The main purpose of this process is to offer similar functionality to those \\r\\ncustomers who are transferred, and to secure smooth and uninterrupted services for them.   \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team continued consolidating distribution channels and improving efficiency in related areas. Six locations in the \\r\\ncustomer service network were closed and two centres were transformed into meet-up points. At the end of the third quarter, \\r\\nLuminor was serving its customers in a total of 36 locations across the Baltics.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cashless concept was introduced in customer service centres across all the Baltic states, and the project was completed in the \\r\\nthird quarter in Estonia. All Luminor’s customer service centres are now cashless and serve customers using alternative tools through \\r\\npayment cards and ATMs.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple Pan-Baltic sales campaigns were launched in consumer and mortgage lending to stabilise new lending volumes following \\r\\nlegislative changes on advertising of loans. Through these campaigns and improved management of sales channels, the retail banking \\r\\nteam has succeeded in sustaining sales volumes in lending and in growing the deposit portfolio compared to the same period last \\r\\nyear. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter of 2019 the Corporate Banking team continued to focus on increasing the profitability of our corporate lending \\r\\nportfolio, reducing the portfolio of non-performing loans,and transferring services for micro enterprises to Retail Banking team. The \\r\\nteam also succeeded in increasing their deposit portfolio during the quarter.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLoan loss provisions increased in the third quarter because of additional provisions in the Estonian non-performing loans book and \\r\\nnew non-performing loans in the Latvian renewable energy sector. The macro environment continues to be very supportive. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main focus in Wealth Management in the third quarter was on growing the business, ensuring high customer satisfaction and \\r\\nexecuting changes in the Pan-Baltic operating model. Collaboration with other business segments supported both growth and \\r\\ncustomer satisfaction.   \\r\\n\\r\\nBy mid-October all the major Management Board level re-appointments had been carried out for pension entities. Approvals had also \\r\\nbeen received from the local financial supervisory authorities. To facilitate an orderly transition, multiple workshops have been held \\r\\nto map functional responsibilities and conflicts of interest, as in the quality and risk analysis (QRA) framework.    \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pension assets under management in the Baltics reached EUR 1.39 billion in the third quarter of 2019, increasing by 13% from \\r\\nthe same quarter of 2018. Luminor had 298 thousand second pillar and 62 thousand third pillar pension customers at the end of the \\r\\nquarter. Total assets under management have grown solidly as financial markets have performed well and the external sales channel \\r\\nfor pension products in Estonia has been successful.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking focused on growing the assets under management and ensuring a high level of customer satisfaction by helping \\r\\naffluent and high net worth individuals and their families to grow, manage and preserve their wealth. During the quarter the Private \\r\\nBanking team also focused on attracting new customers from the market.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 7  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor aims to become the financial partner in the Baltics for the local way of living and doing business. We are dedicated to \\r\\nsupporting sustainable growth in the Baltic region by providing long-term commitment to businesses and individuals, and corporate \\r\\nsocial responsibility is an inseparable part of that. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter of 2019, Luminor started a comprehensive review of its corporate social responsibility policies, procedures and \\r\\nprinciples with the aim of having a more focused and lasting impact in this area. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to this, efforts were made to promote financial and digital literacy and support entrepreneurship, and this included \\r\\nlectures in Luminor customer service centres, work with state agencies to promote and develop cyber security, and a radio \\r\\nprogramme on financial literacy. \\r\\n\\r\\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORTS  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is continuously committed to preventing and detecting money laundering and financial crime, reviewing regularly its AML \\r\\npractices and investing in necessary human and technological capabilities in this field. Being a subject to different legal requirements, \\r\\nLuminor acts in full transparency and collaboration with all relevant supervisory and regulatory authorities. Luminor has developed \\r\\nwide knowledge of its customers as Luminor primarily serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers with a strong \\r\\npersonal or business connection to the Baltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has developed and implemented a financial crime risk management framework to prevent, detect, manage and report \\r\\npotential financial crime risk. The framework consists of financial crime detection technology, comprehensive policies and procedures, \\r\\nregular risk assessments, training and awareness-raising, and ongoing monitoring of new and developing financial crime risks. In \\r\\naddition, Luminor follows international guidelines, recommendations and standards issued by the regulatory and supervisory \\r\\nauthorities, relevant international bodies, local banking associations and financial intelligence units in each Baltic state. Luminor \\r\\ncontinuously invests in its systems and processes to adapt in a constantly changing environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first three quarters of 2019, more than 100 compliance related training sessions and awareness-raising events were carried \\r\\nout. \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 30 SEPTEMBER 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 October, the Supervisory Council appointed Georg Kaltenbrunner as a member of the bank’s Management Board and the new \\r\\nChief Risk Officer. As of 1 November Georg Kaltenbrunner will take over the position from Hannu Saksala. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 October, Indrek Heinloo and Marilin Pikaro were appointed as members of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS by the \\r\\nSupervisory Council of Luminor Bank AS effective as of the same day. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 8  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Results \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s financial results of the third quarter continued to be affected by exceptional and restructuring costs with the focus on \\r\\naccelerating the transformation and building areas of superior customer experience, such as consolidating technological platforms, \\r\\nright-sizing the business, simplifying the product and service portfolio, and increasing efficiency. \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit in the third quarter was EUR 16.9 million, which was EUR 26.3 million lower than in the same quarter of 2018. The loan \\r\\nportfolio declined by 9.2%, while the net interest income-to-loans ratio increased from 2.2% to 2.3% following moves to improve \\r\\nprofitability by ensuring fair and rational pricing of risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses in the third quarter were EUR 71.4 million, which is EUR 17.3 million higher than last year as a result of the \\r\\ntransformation costs incurred and net impairment on loans to customers. Exceptional costs in the third quarter were EUR 22.2 \\r\\nmillion, of which 80% were IT expenses, followed by 12% in other transformation costs, and 8% in staff expenses. Exceptional costs \\r\\nwere EUR 4.1 million higher than in the previous quarter, and EUR 2.3 million of this went on IT expenses for technology \\r\\ndevelopments. Impairment of loans to customers and other assets during the third quarter was EUR 7.3 million, which was EUR 6 \\r\\nmillion less than in the second quarter. This result was mainly affected by a review of several large exposures in the legacy portfolio, \\r\\nwhile the quality of the overall credit portfolio remains good. Moreover, the non-performing loans (“NPL”) ratio has decreased from \\r\\n5.7% to 4.3% over the past 12 months. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of third quarter stood at 108.4%, down from 139.4% a year ago. The decline in the funding gap \\r\\nwas driven by an increase of EUR 1.4 billion in deposits and a decrease of EUR 1.1 billion in loans. \\r\\n\\r\\nKey figures and ratios of Luminor*   \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR \\r\\nQ3 Q2  Q3        January-September Full year \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 2019 2018 2019 2018 2018** \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit 16 887 6 711 43 146 49 965 120 114 124 949 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity 1 624 589 1 718 147 1 766 439 1 716 511 1 751 695 1 757 148 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE), % 4.1 1.6 9.7 3.9 9.2 7.1 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets 13 905 118 14 081 334 14 637 665 14 549 574 14 905 355 15 201 023 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA), % 0.5 0.2 1.2 0.5 1.1 0.8 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 62 104 63 280 66 034 189 198 194 134 259 733 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets 13 579 747 13 723 711 14 245 136 14 230 763 14 514 836 14 844 146 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM), % 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio (C/I), % 73.5 76.0 56.1 75.9 59.1 62.3 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio, %*** 0.33 0.37 -0.16 0.15 -0.14 -0.06 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 10 760 156 10 979 181 11 853 592 10 760 156 11 853 592 11 472 138 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 9 923 439 9 374 812 8 505 854 9 923 439 8 505 854 9 069 885 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio, % 108.4 117.1 139.4 108.4 139.4 126.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET1 ratio, % 18.7 18.0 17.3 18.7 17.3 18.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio (gross), % 4.3 4.3 5.7 4.3 5.7 5.3 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income / Loans, % 2.3 2.3 2.2 2.4 2.2 2.3 \\r\\n\\r\\n* Quarterly ratios and Jan-Sep 2019 ratios (ROE, ROA, NIM, C/I, Credit impairment ratio) are expressed on an annualised basis \\r\\n\\r\\n**Luminor Group AB full year consolidated figures     \\r\\n\\r\\n***If loan recoveries prevail, the ratio is negative \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 9  \\r\\n\\r\\nExplanations  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity (belonging to the owners of the company) = (equity at the end of the reporting period + equity at the end of the previous period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) = Net profit / Average equity * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets = (assets at the end of the reporting period + assets at the end of the previous period) / 2  \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) = Net profit / Average assets * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets = (interest-earning assets at the end of the reporting period + interest-earning assets at the end of the previous period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) = Net interest income / Average interest earning assets * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio = Total operating expenses / Net total operating income * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio = Net losses or reversal on loans to customers / Net loans, average * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio = Loans to customers / Deposits from customers * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio = Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-weighted Assets \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio = Gross impaired loans (Stage 3 loans) / Gross loans * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLENDING AND DEPOSITS  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lending portfolio continued to shrink and at the end of third quarter it totalled EUR 10.8 billion.

Deposits from customers are the main source of funding \\r\\nfor Luminor and made up EUR 9.9 billion or 72.0% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity at the end of the third quarter of 2019, \\r\\nhaving been EUR 9.3 billion or 66.9% at the end of the second quarter. The funding base is predominantly EUR-denominated. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to deposits, Luminor also has outstanding debt securities and funding from parent banks  (i.e. funding from DNB Bank \\r\\nASA and Nordea Bank Abp) that together constitute a substantial part of the funding base. At the end of the third quarter of 2019 \\r\\nthe value of the bonds outstanding under the EMTN programme totalled EUR 658 million, with the transaction of 11 June 2019 \\r\\nbuilding on the inaugural transaction of EUR 350 million from October 2018. The Senior Unsecured Medium-Term Note Program \\r\\nhas been assigned a rating of Baa2 by Moody’s. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2019, funding from parents amounted to EUR 1,260 million and was provided by DNB Bank ASA and \\r\\nNordea Bank Abp in the form of a syndicate, where each syndicate partner provides 50%. Long-term funding is committed for six \\r\\nyears (4+2) starting from 1 October 2017, when Luminor was established. Short-term funding is in the form of revolving credit of 364 \\r\\ndays. In addition to the outstanding funding already utilised, there is also a committed unused credit line of EUR 2,944 million in \\r\\nplace.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the changes in the ownership of Luminor, a new facility agreement has come into force from the fourth quarter of 2019. \\r\\nThe total amount committed to the facility under the new agreement (used and un-used combined) initially had a total commitment \\r\\nof EUR 4,204 million, but which was reducted to EUR 2,837 million at closing of the Blackstone transaction. The facility amount is \\r\\ncommitted for five years from 1 October 2019 and it can be drawn with maturities of one, two or three years. In addition, the new \\r\\nfacility is partly secured, as Luminor has assigned a total of EUR 1,995 million of mortgage loans as collateral to the new facility. The \\r\\npledge on the mortgage loans is applicable from 25 September 2019. The reduction in the overall limit of the new facility agreement \\r\\nwith DNB and Nordea means that the total committed, but unused, credit line declined to EUR 1,577 million from the fourth quarter \\r\\nof 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, \\r\\nwith a stable outlook. There have been no changes to Luminor’s ratings since then. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 15  \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor uses different metrics to measure liquidity risk. One metric used is the LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio). The LCR for Luminor \\r\\nwas 144.8% as at the end of the third quarter by the CRR LCR definition. The liquidity buffer is composed of highly liquid central \\r\\nbank eligible securities and cash. Long-term liquidity risk is measured as the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). As at the end of third \\r\\nquarter of 2019, Luminor’s NSFR was 118.0%. NSFR decreased by 9.4% versus quarter two (Q2 2019: 127.4%) due to mortgages \\r\\npledged for parent funding (see funding section for more information). \\r\\n\\r\\n(percentage) Q3  2019 Q2 2019 Q1 2019 Q4 2018* Q3  2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 144.8% 132.5% 131.2% 189% 130.4% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR 118.0% 127.4% 122.0% 114.0% 106.4% \\r\\n\\r\\n* Luminor Group AB consolidated figures \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are predominantly from residents of the Baltics. In total, 99.1% of all deposits from households and non-\\r\\nfinancial corporations are from EU residents. \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits split by residency per country: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n       Total                   Estonia                      Latvia             Lithuania \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nCAPITAL \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continues to have strong capitalisation that is sufficient to ensure the financial stability and supply the capital needed to \\r\\ndeliver the business strategy. The Total Capital Ratio of Luminor was 18.7% as at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which is \\r\\ncomfortably above the internal target of 17.0%. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Total Capital Ratio is fully covered by Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Luminor uses the Standardised method in the Capital \\r\\nAdequacy calculations to calculate credit and market risk. Operational risk is calculated using the Basic Indicator Approach method.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2019, the Leverage Ratio, calculated using CRR, was 10.9%, compared to 10.6% at the end of the \\r\\nsecond quarter of 2019. The Leverage Ratio is calculated as the bank’s total Tier 1 own funds divided by its total risk exposure \\r\\nmeasure, including the risk positions on assets and off balance sheet liabilities. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n1.2%\\r\\n\\r\\n96.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.0% 1.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.0%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.5% 0.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n96.9%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.6%0.9%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.2%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.9%\\r\\n\\r\\nBaltic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOther EU Non-EU \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 16  \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital ratios  \\r\\n\\r\\nPosition  Q3 2019 Q2 2019 Q1 2019 Q4 2018* Q3 2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital adequacy 18.73% 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% \\r\\n\\r\\nLeverage Ratio 10.89% 10.59% 12.00% 10.38% 10.68% \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 Ratio 18.73% 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% \\r\\n\\r\\nT1 Capital Ratio 18.73% 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Capital Ratio 18.73% 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% \\r\\n\\r\\n   * Luminor Group AB consolidated figures \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOwn funds requirements \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR 30 September 2019 31 December 2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nTOTAL RISK EXPOSURE AMOUNT 8 412 881 9 206 164 \\r\\n\\r\\n1.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE INFORMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nNew company Luminor Holding AS established on the 14th of May 2019 is the new parent company of Luminor Bank AS (the Bank or \\r\\nthe Group) since 23 September 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor Bank AS has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries \\r\\nthrough the Estonian registered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30th of September 2019 a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone acquired a 60% majority stake in the \\r\\nLuminor Holding AS, the owner of Luminor Bank AS. Luminor Bank AS current owners, Nordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB BANK \\r\\nASA (\"DNB\"), will each retain a 20% equity stake in the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 September 2019 Luminor Bank AS directly or indirectly owned majority in the following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Estonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country  \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Latvia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Lithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Liising AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Pensions Estonia AS \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Est OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ (under \\r\\nliquidation)  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Asset Management IPAS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Finance SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Līzings SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Realm SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 2 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 3 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 4 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 6 SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n Trioleta SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Baltic ipasums SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Industrius UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Intractus UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Lit UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Recurso UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Investiciju \\r\\nValdymas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Lizingas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Gėlužės projektai UAB \\r\\n(under liquidation) \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 September 2019 Luminor Bank AS had ownership in the following associated companies (25%): \\r\\n\\r\\n ALD Automotive AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n SIA ALD Automotive \\r\\n\\r\\n UAB ALD Automotive  \\r\\n\\r\\n SIA Kredītinformācijas Birojs \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (the Bank or the Group) was prepared in accordance \\r\\nwith IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed consolidated interim financial \\r\\ninformation does not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in \\r\\nconjunction with the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2018. As described in the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 25  \\r\\n\\r\\nsection Accounting for the merger below, following the merger on 2 January 2019, the condensed consolidated interim financial \\r\\ninformation includes the financial information for 3 merged banks, therefore for the purpose of obtaining annual financial \\r\\ninformation for the same group of entities, we advise the reader to also refer to the consolidated annual financial statements for \\r\\nthe year ended 31 December 2018 of Luminor Bank AS’s parent entity, Luminor Group AB (holding), available at \\r\\nhttps://www.luminor.ee/en/financial-reports. Those consolidated financial statements represent substantially the financial position \\r\\nand results of the 3 merged banks, with certain minor additional balances and transactions from Luminor Group AB (holding) entity. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are consistent with \\r\\nthose followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, \\r\\nexcept for the additional policy for accounting for the merger, and adoption of new and amended standards as set out below. \\r\\n\\r\\nACCOUNTING FOR THE MERGER \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS does not prescribe the method of accounting for transactions under common control. Pursuant to IAS 8, management has \\r\\ndetermined that the merger is accounted for using the predecessor method of accounting. Under this method the financial \\r\\nstatements are presented as if the businesses had been combined from the beginning of the earliest period presented (or the date \\r\\nthat the entities were brought under common control, if later). The assets and liabilities of the banks transferred under common \\r\\ncontrol are recognised at their predecessor values, i.e at their carrying values from the financial statements at the highest level of \\r\\nconsolidation (i.e. Luminor Group AB (holding)). No new goodwill arises under predecessor method. Any difference between the \\r\\nconsideration given and the aggregate book value of the assets and liabilities (as of the date of the transaction) of the acquired \\r\\nentity is included in equity. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the completion of the merger on 2 January 2019, all assets and liabilities of Luminor Bank AS, Luminor Bank Latvia and \\r\\nLuminor Bank Lithuania have been combined with the retrosepective effect. Therefore, 2018 comparatives in this condensed \\r\\nconsolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS include also the financial results of the Luminor Bank Latvia and \\r\\nLuminor Bank Lithuania in accordance with the policy described above.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThis note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on the Group’s financial statements and discloses the new \\r\\naccounting policies that have been applied from 1 January 2019 below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 “Leases” was issued on 13 January 2016 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The new \\r\\nstandard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. All leases result in the \\r\\nlessee obtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and, if lease payments are made over time, also obtaining \\r\\nfinancing. Accordingly, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases as was required by \\r\\nIAS 17 and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Lessees are required to recognize: (a) assets and liabilities for all \\r\\nleases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value; and (b) using depreciation of lease assets \\r\\nseparately from interest on lease liabilities in the income statement. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting \\r\\nrequirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases and account for \\r\\nthose two types of leases differently. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of \\r\\n12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option (‘short-term leases’), and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is \\r\\nof low value (‘low-value assets’). \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustments recognised on adoption of IFRS 16 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group decided that it will apply the standard using the modified retrospective method and has not restated comparatives for \\r\\nthe 2018 reporting period. The Group recognized a right of use asset of 30 623 thousand Euro against a corresponding lease liability \\r\\nin the amount of 33 207 thousand Euro and the impact to the equity as of 1 January 2019 amounts to 2 514 thousand Euro, \\r\\ndecreasing its balance. Net impact on equity was caused by the fact that the Group decided to recognise the right-of-use assets at \\r\\nthe date of initial application, measuring them at their carrying amount as if the standard had been applied since the \\r\\ncommencement date, but discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.luminor.ee/en/financial-reports\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 26  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease liabilities as at 1 January 2019 are reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of 31 December 2018 as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR   \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating lease commitments disclosed as at 31 December 2018                                              36 656 \\r\\n\\r\\nWeighted average incremental borrowing rate as at 1 January 2019 2,45% \\r\\n\\r\\nDiscounted operating lease commitments at 1 January 2019 31 847 \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\nLess  \\r\\n\\r\\nCommitments relating short-term leases  158 \\r\\n\\r\\nAdd  \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustment as a result of a different treatment of extension and termination options 1 518 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal lease liability recognized as at 1 January 2019 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nOf which are:       \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent lease liabilities   4 201 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-current lease liabilities   29 006 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe associated right-of-use assets for property leases were measured on a retrospective basis as if the new rules had always been \\r\\napplied.

Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 4 \\r\\nto15 years but may have extension options as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a \\r\\nwide range of different terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 2018 financial year, leases of property, IT equipment and cars were classified as either finance or operating leases. \\r\\nPayments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) were charged to profit or loss on a straight-\\r\\nline basis over the period of the lease.   \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 January 2019, leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset \\r\\nis available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged \\r\\nto profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability \\r\\nfor each period.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees \\r\\n\\r\\n(d) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option,and \\r\\n\\r\\n(e) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the \\r\\nlessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to \\r\\nobtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo determine incremental borrowing rate we have considered: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. existing borrowings (own funding cost) that need to be adjusted for amount, security, term etc. and \\r\\n2. property yield that need to be adjusted for term, amount, quality of property, potential weighted average cost of capital \\r\\n\\r\\n(WACC) element in yields etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor property leases the Bank has decided the usage of the Bank’s own funding cost as a discount rate. For other assets the Bank \\r\\nuses the interest rate implicit in the lease as discount rate, as it is readily determinable. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the Bank measured the lease liability by:  \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;  \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 28  \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications (like changes in lease term, in the \\r\\nassessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, \\r\\nin future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, including for example a \\r\\nchange to reflect changes in market rental rates following a market rent review and in floating interest rates, or to reflect revised in-\\r\\nsubstance fixed lease payments (payments are structured as variable lease payments, but there is no genuine variability in those \\r\\npayments and those payments contain variable clauses that do not have real economic substance). \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost of the right-of-use asset comprises: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that \\r\\ndate; \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(d) an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it \\r\\nis located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs \\r\\nare incurred to produce inventories. The lessee incurs the obligation for those costs either at the commencement date or as a \\r\\nconsequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications, or to \\r\\nreflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset\\'s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in \\r\\nprofit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment and \\r\\nsmall items of office furniture below 5 000 EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These terms are \\r\\nused to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. The majority of extension and termination options held are \\r\\nexercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn determining the lease term, the management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise \\r\\nan extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included \\r\\nin the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated) and based on the assessment performed, the \\r\\npotential impact is immaterial. \\r\\n\\r\\nMOVEMENTS OF THE GROUP\\'S RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES  \\r\\n\\r\\nSet out below, are the carrying amounts of the Group’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and the movements during the \\r\\nperiod: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR  1 January 2019 30 September 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nRight-of-use assets 30 693 57 277 \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liability 33 207 58 710 \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in total right-of use assets and lease liability is primarily caused by prolonging one existing lease contract, without     \\r\\nincreasing or decreasing the scope of the lease. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 29  \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, and the \\r\\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are \\r\\nbased on management’s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable \\r\\nunder the circumstances. Management also makes certain judgements, apart from those involving estimations, in the process of \\r\\napplying the accounting policies. Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated \\r\\nfinancial statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the \\r\\nnext financial year include. \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognizes the credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The Standard applies a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) \\r\\napproach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held \\r\\nat FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The assets to test for impairment are divided into three \\r\\ngroups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes assets where there has been no significant increase in \\r\\ncredit risk since initial recognition. In stage 1, the allowances equal the 12-month expected credit loss. Stage 2 includes assets \\r\\nwhere there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets. In stage 2 and 3, the allowances \\r\\nequal the lifetime expected credit losses. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for additional \\r\\ncategory - purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) - regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an \\r\\ninstrument.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of \\r\\nvariable inputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates \\r\\ninclude (no major changes comparing to the model applied in calculating the year-end balances) : \\r\\n\\r\\n evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2;  \\r\\n\\r\\n identification of unlikely to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3; \\r\\n\\r\\n assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including the \\r\\nvarious formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\r\\n the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) \\r\\nand exposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\r\\n determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;  \\r\\n\\r\\n estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic and \\r\\npessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;  \\r\\n\\r\\n estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and assigning \\r\\nprobabilities to those scenarios; \\r\\n\\r\\n setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlease refer to Note 12. \\r\\n\\r\\n3.

The swaps are \\r\\nbeing used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of its fixed rate senior unsecured bonds. Trade date for EUR 200 \\r\\nmillion and EUR 150 million interest swap agreements is 10 October 2018, effective date is 18 October 2018 and maturity date is 18 \\r\\nOctober 2021. For EUR 300 million interest swap agreement trade date is 11 June 2019, effective date is 21 June 2019 and maturity \\r\\ndate 21 October 2022. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instruments as the terms of the interest rate swaps \\r\\nmatch the terms of the fixed rate loan (i.e. notional amount, maturity, payment and reset dates). The Group has established a \\r\\nhedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships, as the underlying risk of the interest rate swaps is identical to the hedged risk \\r\\ncomponent. To test hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair \\r\\nvalue of the hedging instrument against the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nHedge ineffectiveness can theoretically arise from: \\r\\n\\r\\n A different interest rate curve applied to discount the hedged item and hedging instrument \\r\\n\\r\\n Differences in the timing of cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument, also a different day count \\r\\n\\r\\n The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instrument and hedged \\r\\nitem. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 35  \\r\\n\\r\\n30.09.2019 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 650 000 8 929 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial for the period 01 January 2019 to 30 September 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 350 000 1 128 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial during 2018.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where \\r\\nthe fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from \\r\\nactive markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The \\r\\ninputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but where observable market data is not available, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 40  \\r\\n\\r\\njudgment is required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements mentioned techniques were not used \\r\\nextensively as no such financial assets and financial liabilities exist on the statement of financial position of the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of loans to customers, customer deposits, amounts due from credit institutions and amounts due to credit institutions \\r\\nand other financial assets and liabilities’ obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the \\r\\nrates currently available for debt on similar terms and remaining maturities. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn assessing the fair value for financial assets, the management has performed a discounted cash flow analysis; up-to-date \\r\\ninformation at the assessment moment is being used for assessing cash flows. For loans where base interest rates are pegged to \\r\\nfloating market interest rates, the Group has considered the difference between the average interest margin of issued loans and the \\r\\naverage interest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has been changed (increased) \\r\\nsince issuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal to the fair value. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of financial liabilities at amortized cost such as Loans and deposits from credit institutions and Deposits from \\r\\ncustomers, which are not on demand, have been estimated based on the discounted cash flow model using interest rates for similar \\r\\nproducts as at year end. The fair value of those financial liabilities that are on demand or have a floating interest rate has been \\r\\nestimated to be approximately equal to it’s carrying amount. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTIZED COST \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR \\r\\nCarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n30.09.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value  \\r\\n\\r\\n30.09.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value  \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortized cost     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and Balances with Central banks 2 399 684 2 399 684 3 293 090 3 293 090 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 174 939 174 939 185 346 185 346 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 10 760 156 10 771 550 11 472 138 11 484 286 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 13 334 779 13 346 173 14 950 574 14 962 722 \\r\\n\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\n\\r\\ninstitutions  \\r\\n1 330 506 1 319 380 3 939 396 3 906 454 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 9 923 439 9 954 653 9 069 885 9 098 414 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 658 393 658 393 351 235 351 235 \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liabilities 58 710 58 710 0 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 49 167     49 167     27 914    27 914    \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 12 020 215 12 040 303 13 388 430 13 384 017 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarizes the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities.

estimate the fair values: \\r\\n\\r\\n Cash and cash balances with central banks – very liquid and short-term, so the fair value equals to their carrying amount as the \\r\\n\\r\\nassets can be realized at same price in an orderly transaction \\r\\n\\r\\n Due from other credit institutions – very liquid and short-term, so the fair value equals to their carrying amount as the assets \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 43  \\r\\n\\r\\ncan be realized at same price in an orderly transaction \\r\\n\\r\\n Derivative financial instruments - fair value for this kind of instruments is calculated using discounted cash flow method through \\r\\n\\r\\nwhich net present value (NPV) is obtained. Independently sourced market parameters – mainly zero coupon yield curves with \\r\\n\\r\\ndifferent characteristics – are used to get discount factors.  To some derivatives hedge accounting rules are applicable.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (Pension Funds) - The value date method is used in the acquisition of pension \\r\\n\\r\\nfund units managed by Luminor Pensions Estonia AS and they are initially recognised at acquisition cost, which is the fair value \\r\\n\\r\\npaid for them. Investments into pension fund units have quoted prices from the market, however the market is inactive and \\r\\n\\r\\ntherefore these are classified as level 2 investments. Information about the NAV of pension funds is made publicly available by \\r\\n\\r\\nthe funds on a daily basis; investments of the managed funds subject for NAV accounting are all categorized as Level 1 \\r\\n\\r\\nInstruments. \\r\\n\\r\\n Loans to customers – Fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows using the market interest rates \\r\\n\\r\\nprevailing at each year-end. Loans are issued on market conditions; For loans, where base interest rates are pegged to floating \\r\\n\\r\\nmarket interest rates, the Group has considered difference between average interest margin of issued loans and average \\r\\n\\r\\ninterest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has been changed (increased) since \\r\\n\\r\\nissuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal to fair value. \\r\\n\\r\\n Loans and deposits from credit institutions- pricing is under market conditions; fair value of deposits do not differ from the \\r\\n\\r\\ncarrying value.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Deposits from customers- pricing of the deposits is under market conditions, the fair value of deposits has been determined \\r\\n\\r\\nusing the future cashflows, fair value of deposits do not differ from the carrying value. \\r\\n\\r\\n Debt securities issued - initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortized cost. \\r\\n\\r\\nBonds are listed but liquidity and market conditions do not allow using market price as reliable input. Management has \\r\\n\\r\\ndetermined the fair value by discounting the future cash flows, using the market interest yield curve. Additional info in  Note 11 \\r\\n\\r\\nwhere impact from hedge accounting is explained. \\r\\n\\r\\n Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income - The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nmeasurement of shares on level 3 (Visa Inc. and Swift shares) are as follows: conversion rate, trading price, liquidity discount. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe management believes that reasonably possible changes to other unobservable inputs would not result in a significant \\r\\n\\r\\nchange in the estimated fair value. Change in fair value of level 3 instruments between 31 December 2018 and 30 September \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 is due to revaluation. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value measurement for liabilities is based on the calculation using non observable inputs thus the same categorization as \\r\\nfor assets should be applied. \\r\\n\\r\\n20. RELATED PARTIES \\r\\n\\r\\nParties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the \\r\\nother party in making financial or operational decisions.   \\r\\n\\r\\nRelated parties are defined as shareholders, members of the Supervisory Council and the Management Board as key management \\r\\npersonnel, their close relatives and companies in which they have a controlling interest as well as associated companies. \\r\\n\\r\\nParent company is considered to be Luminor Holding AS and the ultimate owners are considered to be DNB Bank ASA, Nordea Bank \\r\\nAB and Blackstone. \\r\\n\\r\\nA number of banking transactions are entered into with related parties in the normal course of business.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as Management Board. The Management \\r\\nBoard monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation \\r\\nand performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit before tax and is measured consistently with \\r\\nprofit before tax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of expenses after internal funds transfer \\r\\npricing, as management primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a performance measure. Fees and \\r\\ncommission income for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made between different product \\r\\ncategories for segment reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth Management. \\r\\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. Corporate Banking \\r\\nsegment services business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager. Retail Banking segment services business \\r\\ncustomers without a dedicated relationship manager and private individuals not belonging to Wealth Management segment. \\r\\nWealth Management services wealthy private individuals and holding companies associated with those individuals. Results of other \\r\\noperating segments are included in Other segment. \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments \\r\\n(including internal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Unallocated segment) and income and expenses \\r\\nnot booked on customer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using internally agreed allocation mechanisms. \\r\\nOnly assets and liabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating segments are reported under the respective segments, \\r\\nall other balance sheet items are reported under Other segment. \\r\\n\\r\\nStarting from 2019, new operating model got implemented in Luminor Group and CODM started monitoring operating segments on \\r\\nthe new basis (as described above). Restatement was made for historic periods for comparability.

A lot of \\r\\n\\r\\ngood work has been done in separating Luminor from its former parent banks, building the foundations for an \\r\\n\\r\\nindependent bank and strengthening the organisation. We have also succeeded in changing our funding structure \\r\\n\\r\\nquite substantially and in boosting our overall financial resilience, as we have reduced the loan-to-deposit ratio over \\r\\n\\r\\nthe past year from 126.5% to 99.9%. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 December, the European Central Bank issued a licence to Luminor to issue covered bonds. This is another \\r\\n\\r\\nimportant step towards reaching a fully independent funding structure and in continuing to improve our stability and \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidity position. Luminor is the first bank in the Baltic countries to receive such a licence, and this marks an important \\r\\n\\r\\nmilestone in the development of Baltic financial markets. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter, Luminor also continued building its payment infrastructure and information systems to be \\r\\n\\r\\nindependent of former parent banks. We completed the carve-out of SEPA payment flows, which means that all our \\r\\n\\r\\nSEPA payments are now routed and processed through the Luminor Payment Hub and the Latvian Central Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant progress was also made in establishing an independent correspondent banking network.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s Products and Offering team launched Luminor Investor platform in Lithuania and Latvia as a platform tailored \\r\\n\\r\\nfor investors with different levels of experience and offering over 14,500 financial instruments. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team continued to focus on total customer asset growth in deposits and investments, while the \\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate Banking team was preparing to return to lending growth after successfully repricing the legacy portfolios \\r\\n\\r\\nand reducing the portfolio of non-performing loans. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur Wealth Management segment concentrated on growing the business and on customer satisfaction. The pension \\r\\n\\r\\nassets under management reached EUR 1.45 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was 20% more than in the \\r\\n\\r\\nsame quarter of 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to adapt in a constantly changing environment, we continued to invest in the systems and processes that we \\r\\n\\r\\nhave developed to prevent, detect, manage and report potential financial crime risk. In the fourth quarter, 68 \\r\\n\\r\\ncompliance-related training events were organized at Luminor with coverage over 17 different topics. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic states remain some of the faster-growing economies of the EU, outpacing the euro area average by a solid \\r\\n\\r\\nmargin. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Luminor completed an important part of its overall transformation. After \\r\\n\\r\\nrightsizing the organisation and repricing the bank’s portfolio, Luminor is now ready to enter a stage of growth. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\n\\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n4  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nOverview \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (“Luminor”) was established on 1 October 2017 by the merger of the operations in the Baltic states \\r\\n\\r\\nof DNB Bank ASA (Commercial Register no. 984 851 006) and Nordea Bank AB (currently Nordea Bank Abp, as Nordea \\r\\n\\r\\nhas been domiciled in Finland since 1 October 2018 following the cross-border reversed merger between Nordea Bank \\r\\n\\r\\nAB (publ) and Nordea Bank Abp, registration no. 2858394-9) to create a new-generation financial service provider for \\r\\n\\r\\nlocal businesses and financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 it was announced that the transaction signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB Bank ASA \\r\\n\\r\\nand Nordea Bank AB and the US-based private equity firm Blackstone had been closed, and as a result a consortium \\r\\n\\r\\nled by private equity funds managed by Blackstone acquired a 60% majority stake in the bank. The bank’s initial owners \\r\\n\\r\\nNordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB Bank ASA (\"DNB\") each retained a 20% equity stake in Luminor, but an \\r\\n\\r\\nagreement has been signed by Blackstone and Nordea for the purchase of Nordea’s 20% stake over the coming years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with approximately 1 million clients, 2489 \\r\\n\\r\\nemployees, and market share of 16.6% in deposits and 18.7% in lending as at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal shareholders’ equity amounts to EUR 1.6 billion and Luminor is capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 19.7%. Luminor’s \\r\\n\\r\\nvision is to become the best financial ecosystem for its customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers a wide range of products and services to its customers through all possible channels, digital and \\r\\n\\r\\nphysical, with a total of 34 customer service centres, of which 8 are meet-up points, in total in Latvia, Lithuania and \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia. Luminor owns 357 ATMs throughout the Baltic states, and additionally provides services through 100 ATMs in \\r\\n\\r\\npartnership with other financial services providers. \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Estonia Latvia Lithuania GroupGr Total  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of customers ~134 000 ~229 000 ~577 000 ~940 000 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket shares      \\r\\n\\r\\nLending 13.9% 23.0% 20.3% 18.7% \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits 9.9% 17.5% 21.2% 16.6% \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of client service \\r\\n\\r\\ncentres, including meet- \\r\\n\\r\\nup points \\r\\n\\r\\n8 10 16 34  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of employees 577 887 1025 2489 \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of fourth quarter Luminor had 24 subsidiaries in the Baltics: Luminor Asset Management IPAS (Latvia), \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS (Latvia), UAB Luminor Investiciju valdymas (Lithuania), and Luminor Pensions \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia AS (Estonia) manage pension assets; Recurso UAB (Lithuania), Promano Lit UAB (Lithuania), Industrius UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n(Lithuania), Gėlužės projektai LUAB (Lithuania), Intractus UAB (Lithuania), Promano Estonia OÜ (Estonia), Luminor \\r\\n\\r\\nFinance SIA (Latvia), Realm SIA (Latvia), Trioleta SIA (Latvia), Baltic ipašums SIA (Latvia), Promano Lat SIA (Latvia),  Salvus \\r\\n\\r\\nSIA (Latvia), Salvus 2 SIA (Latvia), Salvus 3 SIA (Latvia), Salvus 4 SIA (Latvia), and Salvus 6 SIA (Latvia) are property \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n5  \\r\\n\\r\\nmanagement companies; and Luminor Liising AS (Estonia), Luminor Līzings SIA (Latvia), Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n(Latvia), and Luminor Lizingas UAB (Lithuania) provide leasing services.     \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 October, the Supervisory Council of Luminor elected Georg Kaltenbrunner as a member of the bank’s \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement Board and new Chief Risk Officer. Georg Kaltenbrunner took over the position on 1 November from \\r\\n\\r\\nHannu Saksala.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 December 2019, the European Central Bank issued a licence to Luminor to issue covered bonds following the \\r\\n\\r\\nassessment of the Estonian Financial Supervision Authority. Luminor is the first bank in the Baltic states to receive such \\r\\n\\r\\na licence. \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview  \\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal trade and the global economy continued to soften on the back of trade uncertainty, heightened geopolitical \\r\\n\\r\\nrisks, and a slowdown in manufacturing that spread to other parts of the global economy, albeit to a limited degree. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdvanced and emerging markets experienced headwinds with weaker economic confidence and growth resting largely \\r\\n\\r\\non domestic demand as the key driver. While global manufacturing is still experiencing substantial weakness, there \\r\\n\\r\\nare early signs of stabilisation. Services are poised to face soft growth as there has so far been limited spill-over to \\r\\n\\r\\nthe more strongly performing services sector, which benefits from domestic demand and supportive financial \\r\\n\\r\\nconditions. There has been a tepid recovery to an uninspiring level of growth, but with diminished economic and \\r\\n\\r\\npolicy risks. \\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth moderated in the key export markets for the Baltics, including the euro area and the Nordic countries, and the \\r\\n\\r\\noutlook for growth was subdued. Growth in the euro area, the key destination for Baltic exports, decelerated noticeably, \\r\\n\\r\\nwith GDP growing only by around 1.2% year on year, and 0.2% quarter on quarter in the second and third quarters of \\r\\n\\r\\n2019, reflecting a drag from industry and trade. The risk of a hard Brexit added to the economic uncertainty in the UK \\r\\n\\r\\nand in related EU economies. The euro area slowdown is now showing tentative signs of bottoming out as the \\r\\n\\r\\neconomies that are more open to global trade, including Germany, go through a soft patch. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic states along with Ireland, Poland, Hungary and some southern European peers like Malta today have some \\r\\n\\r\\nof the fastest growing economies in the EU. The Baltic economies have expanded robustly, outpacing the euro area \\r\\n\\r\\naverage by a solid margin, with annual real GDP growth averaging 5% in Estonia and around 4% in Latvia and Lithuania \\r\\n\\r\\nsince 2017. The average in the euro area meanwhile was 2%.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic countries have exceeded expectations and have so far largely escaped disruption to trade, as they sustained \\r\\n\\r\\nsofter, but still broadly based, momentum in their economies in the third quarter, benefiting not least from investment, \\r\\n\\r\\nconsumption and healthy residential construction. Annual growth in the third quarter was 4.1% in Estonia, 1.9% in \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvia and 3.6% in Lithuania, as the growth trend remained moderate. \\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the external headwinds and the slower expansion in key export markets, growth has started to weaken gradually, \\r\\n\\r\\nalbeit from high levels, but labour markets are still firm and tight. The economies are integrated, so all the European \\r\\n\\r\\neconomies will go through the current cyclical softness in trade to different degrees, and will face headwinds for export \\r\\n\\r\\ndemand.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n6  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe expect growth to weaken only gradually given the continued support from strong labour markets and healthy \\r\\n\\r\\ndomestic demand, which remain the key engine of growth. The consumer still holds strong in advanced countries \\r\\n\\r\\nincluding the Baltic states and the labour markets remain tight, though there are early signs of wage and labour \\r\\n\\r\\ndemand moderating in future from their current robust levels.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the first phase of the trade deal between the US and China signed, there is more cautious optimism about a \\r\\n\\r\\nrecovery in global trade. The worst may be over for European manufacturers, while domestic demand is still robust \\r\\n\\r\\nand unemployment is close to a record low.   \\r\\n\\r\\nActivities \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor completed its cross-border merger on 2 January 2019 and continues its operations in all the three Baltic \\r\\n\\r\\nstates through the bank headquartered in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the \\r\\n\\r\\nmerger, all the assets, rights and liabilities of Luminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) were transferred \\r\\n\\r\\nto Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank continues its activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established \\r\\n\\r\\nbranches. A new organisational set up and a new governance structure were also introduced, and new members of \\r\\n\\r\\nthe management bodies were appointed. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the cross-border merger, the deposits and holdings in financial instruments of the customers of Luminor \\r\\n\\r\\nBank AS Latvian branch and Luminor Bank AS Lithuanian branch are guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and investor \\r\\n\\r\\nprotection scheme established and operated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to roll out the new operating model during the fourth quarter by simplifying its structure and \\r\\n\\r\\ndecision-making process, unifying and executing IT consolidation, strengthening its controls, and becoming more \\r\\n\\r\\nefficient, more resilient and more resolvable.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Luminor continued building its payment infrastructure and information systems that are \\r\\n\\r\\nindependent of its former parent banks. In November 2019, \\u202fLuminor completed the carve out of SEPA payment flows \\r\\n\\r\\nso that all the SEPA payments as of that date are routed and processed through the Luminor Payment Hub and the \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvian Central Bank. Luminor has also established its own correspondent banking network and carved out the \\r\\n\\r\\ninternational payment flows that were previously routed and processed via the systems and correspondent banking \\r\\n\\r\\naccounts of DNB Bank. Luminor is also progressing with the equivalent change to international payment flows \\r\\n\\r\\nprocessed through the Nordea Group, with plans to become fully independent during the first half of 2020.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe gradual migration of the legacy Nordea customers to the Luminor information systems continued in Latvia, \\r\\n\\r\\nresulting in the successful transfer of some 30% of active legacy Nordea customers by the end of 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, Luminor started issuing Qualified Smart ID, which is a digital authentication tool with \\r\\n\\r\\nqualified e-signature, in its customer services centres. The launch was made in all three Baltic countries. Around 92% \\r\\n\\r\\nof new customers use this solution to access the bank’s digital channels. It creates a way to deliver and sign up for \\r\\n\\r\\nmore complex products through digital channels in the very near future. \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Luminor continued the migration of customer and product data and services to the \\r\\n\\r\\nunified Luminor system in Latvia. The process of migrating the customers to the targeted unified systems is progressing \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n7  \\r\\n\\r\\naccording to plan and will be finalised in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn October the Luminor Investor platform was launched in Lithuania and Latvia. The investment platform is tailored for \\r\\n\\r\\ninvestors of all levels of experience and offers a wide range of non-complex financial instruments, with more than \\r\\n\\r\\n14,500. The platform was built jointly with Scandinavian partners and provides a simplified customer experience and \\r\\n\\r\\nthe option for customers to build their savings at their own pace. The launch of the platform in Estonia is planned for \\r\\n\\r\\nthe first quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team continued to focus on growing total customer assets in deposits and investments. After the \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Investor platform was launched, more than 100 retail customers started to use it and the total portfolio \\r\\n\\r\\ninvested through the platform by retail customers reached 650 thousand EUR at the end of the year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe team also executed a sales campaign for the third pillar pension across the Baltics and achieved a new record \\r\\n\\r\\nsales portfolio of 7.4 million EUR.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team continued to consolidate the distribution channels and improve efficiency in related areas. \\r\\n\\r\\nThree new concept meet-up points were opened in Lithuania during the fourth quarter, and at the end of the fourth \\r\\n\\r\\nquarter, Luminor was serving its customers in a total of 34 locations across the Baltics.    \\r\\n\\r\\nThe team continued to put its emphasis on advancing customer service quality as well, so frontline advisory training \\r\\n\\r\\nsessions were held, and 345 advisors and managers were trained during the extensive practical training sessions. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019 the Corporate Banking team continued to focus on increasing the profitability of our \\r\\n\\r\\ncorporate lending portfolio and reducing the portfolio of non-performing loans. The team also succeeded in increasing \\r\\n\\r\\nthe corporate deposit portfolio during the quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nLoan loss provisions in the fourth quarter were higher than in the previous year because of additional provisions for \\r\\n\\r\\nthe non-performing loan book. The macro environment continues to be very supportive. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main focus in the Wealth Management segment in the fourth quarter was on growing the business, with the focus \\r\\n\\r\\non high customer satisfaction and preparing for the possible changes in the pension system in Estonia.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCollaboration with other business segments supported both growth and customer satisfaction in the Private Banking \\r\\n\\r\\nand the Pensions segments.    \\r\\n\\r\\nAll the major Management Board level re-appointments have been made for the Luminor pension entities, and \\r\\n\\r\\napprovals have been received from the local financial supervisory authorities. To facilitate an orderly transition, multiple \\r\\n\\r\\nworkshops have been held to map functional responsibilities and conflicts of interest, as in the quality and risk analysis \\r\\n\\r\\n(QRA) framework.     \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pension assets under management in the Baltics reached EUR 1.45 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, increasing \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n8  \\r\\n\\r\\nby 20% from the same quarter of 2018. Total assets under management have grown solidly as financial markets have \\r\\n\\r\\nperformed well and the external sales channel for pension products in Estonia has been successful.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor had 295 thousand second pillar and 62 thousand third pillar pension customers at the end of the quarter.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Private Banking team focused on growing the assets under management and reached EUR 1.42 billion in the \\r\\n\\r\\nfourth quarter of 2019, increasing by 19% from the same quarter of 2018. The focus remains on ensuring a high level \\r\\n\\r\\nof customer satisfaction by helping affluent and high net worth individuals and their families to grow, manage and \\r\\n\\r\\npreserve their wealth. During the quarter the Private Banking team introduced a new VISA Infinite card for the Private \\r\\n\\r\\nBanking segment in Latvia. Lithuania and Estonia will follow.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter Luminor continued with the review of its ESG principles and how they are implemented, and \\r\\n\\r\\ncontinued with its efforts to promote financial literacy and education and to support sustainable business and local \\r\\n\\r\\nentrepreneurship.  \\r\\n\\r\\nA range of financial literacy classes and talks were given to school children, and lectures on saving and on pensions \\r\\n\\r\\nwere given to university students. Initiatives to promote digital literacy and cyber security were supported. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor organised a series of seminars for its customers to support an entrepreneurial attitude and share best practices \\r\\n\\r\\nin building and maintaining a sustainable career or business, with advice on marketing, insurance, finance, and work-\\r\\n\\r\\nlife balance. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor sold 28 works of art at an auction, the proceeds of which were donated to create an interdisciplinary computer \\r\\n\\r\\nscience course, the Baltic IT Leadership Bachelor Program, launched by Riga Technical University and the University of \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvia in cooperation with the State University of New York at Buffalo, USA. The programme is run by the Riga Business \\r\\n\\r\\nSchool of RTU and gives 22 young people a chance to start their studies on the new course. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to all that, a Luminor scholarship was awarded to one university student to promote new ideas in local \\r\\n\\r\\ntechnology and the local economy, and to help reduce the ecological footprint. \\r\\n\\r\\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORTS  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is continuously committed to preventing and detecting money laundering and financial crime, reviewing its \\r\\n\\r\\nAML practices regularly, and investing in the necessary human and technological capabilities in this field. As it is subject \\r\\n\\r\\nto a range of legal requirements, Luminor acts in full transparency and in collaboration with all the relevant supervisory \\r\\n\\r\\nand regulatory authorities. Luminor predominantly serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers \\r\\n\\r\\nwith a strong personal or business connection to the Baltic states. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has developed and implemented a financial crime risk management framework to prevent, detect, manage \\r\\n\\r\\nand report potential financial crime risk. The framework consists of financial crime detection technology, comprehensive \\r\\n\\r\\npolicies and procedures, regular risk assessments, training and awareness-raising, and ongoing monitoring of new and \\r\\n\\r\\ndeveloping financial crime risks. In addition, Luminor follows international guidelines, recommendations and standards \\r\\n\\r\\nissued by the regulatory and supervisory authorities, relevant international bodies, local banking associations and \\r\\n\\r\\nfinancial intelligence units in each Baltic state. Luminor continuously invests in its systems and processes to adapt in a \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n9  \\r\\n\\r\\nconstantly changing environment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor considers awareness raising activities as an important component of the financial crime risk management \\r\\n\\r\\nframework. During the fourth quarter, 68 compliance-related training events were held on 17 different topics.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 31 DECEMBER 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 January Moody\\'s Investors Service assigned a provisional (P) Aa1 long-term rating to the mortgage covered \\r\\n\\r\\nbonds to be issued by Luminor Bank AS, under by the Estonian Covered Bonds Act. The credit analysis by Moody’s \\r\\n\\r\\nconsidered among other things the credit quality of the assets backing the covered bonds, the Estonian legal \\r\\n\\r\\nframework providing for regulation and supervision of the issuer, and the cover pool exposure to market risk and the \\r\\n\\r\\nlevel of over-collateralisation.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n10  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Results \\r\\n\\r\\nThe funding structure continued to change during the quarter leading to an increase of 12.9% in the deposits portfolio \\r\\n\\r\\nand a decline of 10.9% in the loan portfolio from a year earlier. The loan-to-deposit ratio has fallen from 126.5% to \\r\\n\\r\\n99.9% over the past 12 months. Net profit in the fourth quarter was by EUR 0.7 million higher than in the same period \\r\\n\\r\\nof 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income fell from EUR 65.3 million in the fourth quarter of the previous year to EUR 55.0 million in that \\r\\n\\r\\nquarter of 2019. Interest income remained at a similar level to what it was a year earlier thanks to the successful right-\\r\\n\\r\\nsizing of the business to ensure fair and rational pricing of risk. Interest expenses increased by EUR 8.0 million as a \\r\\n\\r\\nresult of the continuous work to become an independently funded bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses in the fourth quarter were EUR 78.4 million, which is EUR 7.5 million higher than last year. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe result is mainly explained by the transformation costs incurred. Exceptional costs in the fourth quarter were EUR \\r\\n\\r\\n19.2 million, of which 88% were IT expenses for technology developments and the rest were other transformation \\r\\n\\r\\ncosts. \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment of loans to customers were EUR 11.7 million in the fourth quarter, which is EUR 5.6 million higher than \\r\\n\\r\\nthey were in the same period of the previous year, while the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio continued to improve \\r\\n\\r\\nto 3.8%. \\r\\n\\r\\nKey figures and ratios of Luminor*   \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR \\r\\nQ4 Q3  Q4        January-December \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 2019 2018 2019 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit 4 032 16 887 3 333 53 997 123 447 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity 1 633 540 1 624 589 1 793 679 1 715 240 1 756 227 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE), % 1.0 4.1 0.7 3.1 7.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets 13 764 821 13 905 118 15 012 427 14 523 417 15 201 099 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA), % 0.1 0.5 0.1 0.4 0.8 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 54 969 62 104 65 275 244 167 259 409 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets 13 458 875 13 579 747 14 739 778 14 192 831 14 844 146 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM), % 1.6 1.8 1.8 1.7 1.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio (C/I), % 82.8 73.5 74.5 77.6 63.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio, %*** 0.44 0.33 0.21 0.22 -0.05 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 10 222 547 10 760 156 11 472 138 10 222 547 11 472 138 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 10 235 443 9 923 439 9 069 885 10 235 443 9 069 885 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio, % 99.9 108.4 126.5 99.9 126.5 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET1 ratio, % 19.7 18.7 18.0** 19.7 18.0** \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio (gross), % 3.8 4.3 5.3** 3.8 5.3** \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income / Loans, % 2.1 2.3 2.3 2.4 2.3 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n11  \\r\\n\\r\\n* Quarterly ratios and Jan-Dec 2019 ratios (ROE, ROA, NIM, C/I, Credit impairment ratio) are expressed on an annualised basis \\r\\n\\r\\n**Luminor Group AB full year consolidated figures     \\r\\n\\r\\n***If loan recoveries prevail, the ratio is negative \\r\\n\\r\\nExplanations  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity (belonging to the owners of the company) = (equity at the end of the reporting period + equity at the end of the previous \\r\\n\\r\\nperiod) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) = Net profit / Average equity * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets = (assets at the end of the reporting period + assets at the end of the previous period) / 2  \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) = Net profit / Average assets * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets = (interest-earning assets at the end of the reporting period + interest-earning assets at the end of the \\r\\n\\r\\nprevious period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) = Net interest income / Average interest earning assets * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio = Total operating expenses / Net total operating income * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio = Net losses or reversal on loans to customers / Net loans, average * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio = Loans to customers / Deposits from customers * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio = Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-weighted Assets \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio = Gross impaired loans (Stage 3 loans) / Gross loans * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLENDING AND DEPOSITS  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers totalled EUR 10.2 billion at the end of fourth quarter, having been EUR 11.5 billion previous year. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition of loans has changed slightly during the past 12 months as the share of loans to individual customers \\r\\n\\r\\nhas increased from 51% to 55% and share of loans to business customers has declined from 46% to 43%, at Baltic \\r\\n\\r\\nlevel.

The share of impaired loans in the total loan portfolio, shown as the \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio, was 3.8% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, down 0.5 percentage point from the previous quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe NPL ratio for the mortgage loans portfolio stood at 2.9% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, down 0.4 \\r\\n\\r\\npercentage point from the previous quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe reduction of EUR 81.6 million in the amount of impaired loans was faster than the reduction of EUR 13.4 million \\r\\n\\r\\nin allowances for impaired loans, and this increased the Stage 3 impairment ratio. At the end of the fourth quarter of \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 the ratio of allowances to impaired loans, shown as the Stage 3 impairment ratio, stood at 36.7%, which was up \\r\\n\\r\\n3.5 percentage points on the previous quarter. The level of allowances for impaired mortgage loans alone was 26.3% \\r\\n\\r\\nat the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe impairment ratio for the total loan portfolio did not change significantly during the quarter and was 1.8% at the \\r\\n\\r\\nend of the fourth quarter of 2019.

Deposits from customers are the main \\r\\n\\r\\nsource of funding for Luminor and made up EUR 10.2 billion or 74.5% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity at \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n17  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe end of the fourth quarter of 2019, having been EUR 9.9 billion or 72.0% at the end of the third quarter. The funding \\r\\n\\r\\nbase is predominantly EUR-denominated. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to deposits, Luminor also has outstanding debt securities and funding from its former parent banks, DNB \\r\\n\\r\\nBank ASA and Nordea Bank Abp, that together constitute a substantial part of the funding base. At the end of the \\r\\n\\r\\nfourth quarter of 2019 the value of outstanding bonds under the EMTN programme totalled EUR 652 million, with the \\r\\n\\r\\ntransaction of 11 June 2019 building on the inaugural transaction of EUR 350 million from October 2018. The Senior \\r\\n\\r\\nUnsecured Medium-Term Note Program has been assigned a rating of Baa2 by Moody’s. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, funding from former parents amounted to EUR 905 million and was provided \\r\\n\\r\\nby DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank Abp in the form of a syndicate, where each syndicate partner provides 50%. \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the changes in the ownership of Luminor, a new wording of the facility agreement has come into force from \\r\\n\\r\\nthe fourth quarter of 2019. The total amount committed to the facility under the new agreement (used and un-used \\r\\n\\r\\ncombined) is EUR 2,837 million at the closure of the Blackstone transaction. The facility amount is committed for five \\r\\n\\r\\nyears from 1 October 2019 and it can be drawn with maturities of one, two or three years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the facility is partly secured, as Luminor has assigned mortgage loans with a carrying value of EUR 1,929 \\r\\n\\r\\nmillion as collateral. The pledge on the mortgage loans is applicable from 25 September 2019. The reduction in the \\r\\n\\r\\noverall limit of the new wording facility agreement with DNB and Nordea means that the total committed but unused \\r\\n\\r\\ncredit line was EUR 1,932 million as at the of the fourth quarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of \\r\\n\\r\\nBaa1/Prime-2, with a stable outlook. There have been no changes to Luminor’s ratings since then.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 January 2020, Moody’s assigned a provisional (P) Aa1 long-term rating to the mortgage covered bonds issued \\r\\n\\r\\nby Luminor Bank AS, which are governed by the Estonian Covered Bonds Act. \\r\\n\\r\\n314\\r\\n\\r\\n4 578\\r\\n4 034\\r\\n\\r\\n1 623\\r\\n\\r\\n905\\r\\n652\\r\\n\\r\\n1 632\\r\\n\\r\\nAll other\\r\\nLiabilities*\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate\\r\\ndeposits\\r\\n\\r\\nRetail deposits Public sector\\r\\ndeposits\\r\\n\\r\\nParent Funding Senior Issuance Equity\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n18  \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor uses different metrics to measure liquidity risk. One metric used is the LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio). The \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR for Luminor was 149.8% as at the end of the fourth quarter by the CRR LCR definition. The liquidity buffer is \\r\\n\\r\\ncomposed of highly liquid central bank eligible securities and cash. Long-term liquidity risk is measured as the Net \\r\\n\\r\\nStable Funding Ratio (NSFR). As at the end of fourth quarter of 2019, Luminor’s NSFR was 123.0%. The NSFR increased \\r\\n\\r\\nby 5.0% from the third quarter of 2019, when it was 118.0%, mainly due to the decline of the loan portfolio, which \\r\\n\\r\\nrequires stable funding. \\r\\n\\r\\n(percentage) Q4  2019 Q3  2019 Q2  2019 Q1 2019 Q4  2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 149.8% 144.3% 132.5% 131.2% 189% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR 123.0% 118.0% 127.4% 122.0% 114.0% \\r\\n\\r\\n* Luminor Group AB consolidated figures \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are predominantly from residents of the Baltics.

The Total Capital Ratio of Luminor was 19.7% as at the end of the fourth \\r\\n\\r\\nquarter of 2019, which is comfortably above the internal target of 17.0%. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Total Capital Ratio is fully covered by Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Luminor uses the Standardised method \\r\\n\\r\\nin the Capital Adequacy calculations to calculate credit and market risk.

Luminor Bank AS current owners, Nordea Bank Abp \\r\\n\\r\\n(\"Nordea\") and DNB BANK ASA (\"DNB\"), each retains a 20% equity stake in the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 December 2019 Luminor Bank AS directly or indirectly owned majority in the following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Estonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country  \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Latvia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Lithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Liising AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Pensions Estonia \\r\\n\\r\\nAS \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Estonia OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Asset Management IPAS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Finance SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds \\r\\n\\r\\nAS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Līzings SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Realm SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 2 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 3 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 4 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 6 SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n Trioleta SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Baltic ipasšums SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Industrius UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Intractus UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Lit UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Recurso UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Investiciju \\r\\n\\r\\nValdymas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Lizingas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Gėlužės projektai UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n(under liquidation) \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n31  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 December 2019 Luminor Bank AS had ownership in the following associated companies (25%): \\r\\n\\r\\n ALD Automotive AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n ALD Automotive SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n ALD Automotive UAB  \\r\\n\\r\\n SIA Kredītinformācijas Birojs \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (the Bank or the Group) was prepared \\r\\n\\r\\nin accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed consolidated \\r\\n\\r\\ninterim financial information does not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial \\r\\n\\r\\nstatements and should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year \\r\\n\\r\\nended 31 December 2018. As described in the section Accounting for the merger below, following the merger on 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 2019, the condensed consolidated interim financial information includes the financial information for 3 merged \\r\\n\\r\\nbanks, therefore for the purpose of obtaining annual financial information for the same group of entities, we advise \\r\\n\\r\\nthe reader to also refer to the consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 of \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS’s parent entity, Luminor Group AB (holding), available at https://www.luminor.ee/en/financial-reports. \\r\\n\\r\\nThose consolidated financial statements represent substantially the financial position and results of the 3 merged \\r\\n\\r\\nbanks, with certain minor additional balances and transactions from Luminor Group AB (holding) entity. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are \\r\\n\\r\\nconsistent with those followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year \\r\\n\\r\\nended 31 December 2018, except for the additional policy for accounting for the merger, and adoption of new and \\r\\n\\r\\namended standards as set out below. \\r\\n\\r\\nACCOUNTING FOR THE MERGER \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS does not prescribe the method of accounting for transactions under common control. Pursuant to IAS 8, \\r\\n\\r\\nmanagement has determined that the merger is accounted for using the predecessor method of accounting. Under \\r\\n\\r\\nthis method the financial statements are presented as if the businesses had been combined from the beginning of the \\r\\n\\r\\nearliest period presented (or the date that the entities were brought under common control, if later). The assets and \\r\\n\\r\\nliabilities of the banks transferred under common control are recognised at their predecessor values, i.e at their carrying \\r\\n\\r\\nvalues from the financial statements at the highest level of consolidation (i.e. Luminor Group AB (holding)). No new \\r\\n\\r\\ngoodwill arises under predecessor method. Any difference between the consideration given and the aggregate book \\r\\n\\r\\nvalue of the assets and liabilities (as of the date of the transaction) of the acquired entity is included in equity. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the completion of the merger on 2 January 2019, all assets and liabilities of Luminor Bank AS, Luminor Bank \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvia and Luminor Bank Lithuania have been combined with the retrosepective effect. Therefore, 2018 comparatives \\r\\n\\r\\nin this condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS include also the financial results of \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Luminor Bank Latvia and Luminor Bank Lithuania in accordance with the policy described above.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.luminor.ee/en/financial-reports\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n32  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on the Group’s financial statements and discloses the \\r\\n\\r\\nnew accounting policies that have been applied from 1 January 2019 below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 “Leases” was issued on 13 January 2016 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January \\r\\n\\r\\n2019. The new standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll leases result in the lessee obtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and, if lease payments are \\r\\n\\r\\nmade over time, also obtaining financing. Accordingly, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating \\r\\n\\r\\nleases or finance leases as was required by IAS 17 and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Lessees \\r\\n\\r\\nare required to recognize: (a) assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the \\r\\n\\r\\nunderlying asset is of low value; and (b) using depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nin the income statement. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, \\r\\n\\r\\na lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases and account for those two types of leases \\r\\n\\r\\ndifferently. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, has a \\r\\n\\r\\nlease term of 12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option (‘short-term leases’), and lease contracts for \\r\\n\\r\\nwhich the underlying asset is of low value (‘low-value assets’). \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustments recognised on adoption of IFRS 16 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group decided that it will apply the standard using the modified retrospective method and has not restated \\r\\n\\r\\ncomparatives for the 2018 reporting period. The Group recognized a right of use asset of 30 623 thousand Euro \\r\\n\\r\\nagainst a corresponding lease liability in the amount of 33 207 thousand Euro and the impact to the equity as of 1 \\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 2019 amounts to 2 514 thousand Euro, decreasing its balance. Net impact on equity was caused by the fact \\r\\n\\r\\nthat the Group decided to recognise the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application, measuring them at their \\r\\n\\r\\ncarrying amount as if the standard had been applied since the commencement date, but discounted using the \\r\\n\\r\\nincremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease liabilities as at 1 January 2019 are reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of 31 December 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nas follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR   \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating lease commitments disclosed as at 31 December 2018                                              36 656 \\r\\n\\r\\nWeighted average incremental borrowing rate as at 1 January 2019 2,45% \\r\\n\\r\\nDiscounted operating lease commitments at 1 January 2019 31 847 \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\nLess  \\r\\n\\r\\nCommitments relating short-term leases  158 \\r\\n\\r\\nAdd  \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustment as a result of a different treatment of extension and termination options 1 518 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n33  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal lease liability recognized as at 1 January 2019 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nOf which are:       \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent lease liabilities   4 201 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-current lease liabilities   29 006 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe associated right-of-use assets for property leases were measured on a retrospective basis as if the new rules had \\r\\n\\r\\nalways been applied.

Rental contracts are typically made for fixed \\r\\n\\r\\nperiods of 4 to 15 years but may have extension options as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an \\r\\n\\r\\nindividual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 2018 financial year, leases of property, IT equipment and cars were classified as either finance or operating \\r\\n\\r\\nleases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) were charged to profit \\r\\n\\r\\nor loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.   \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 January 2019, leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which \\r\\n\\r\\nthe leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance \\r\\n\\r\\ncost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of \\r\\n\\r\\ninterest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees \\r\\n\\r\\n(d) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option,and \\r\\n\\r\\n(e) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, \\r\\n\\r\\nthe lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds \\r\\n\\r\\nnecessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo determine incremental borrowing rate we have considered: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. existing borrowings (own funding cost) that need to be adjusted for amount, security, term etc. and \\r\\n\\r\\n2. property yield that need to be adjusted for term, amount, quality of property, potential weighted average cost \\r\\n\\r\\nof capital (WACC) element in yields etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor property leases the Bank has decided the usage of the Bank’s own funding cost as a discount rate. For other assets \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Bank uses the interest rate implicit in the lease as discount rate, as it is readily determinable. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the Bank measured the lease liability by:  \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;  \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and  \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications (like changes in lease term, in \\r\\n\\r\\nthe assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual \\r\\n\\r\\nvalue guarantee, in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n35  \\r\\n\\r\\npayments, including for example a change to reflect changes in market rental rates following a market rent review and \\r\\n\\r\\nin floating interest rates, or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments (payments are structured as variable \\r\\n\\r\\nlease payments, but there is no genuine variability in those payments and those payments contain variable clauses \\r\\n\\r\\nthat do not have real economic substance). \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost of the right-of-use asset comprises: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not \\r\\n\\r\\npaid at that date; \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(d) an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the \\r\\n\\r\\nsite on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of \\r\\n\\r\\nthe lease, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories. The lessee incurs the obligation for those costs either \\r\\n\\r\\nat the commencement date or as a consequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease \\r\\n\\r\\nmodifications, or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset\\'s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line \\r\\n\\r\\nbasis. \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as \\r\\n\\r\\nan expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets \\r\\n\\r\\ncomprise IT-equipment and small items of office furniture below 5 000 EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese terms are used to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. The majority of extension and \\r\\n\\r\\ntermination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn determining the lease term, the management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive \\r\\n\\r\\nto exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination \\r\\n\\r\\noptions) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated) and \\r\\n\\r\\nbased on the assessment performed, the potential impact is immaterial. \\r\\n\\r\\nMOVEMENTS OF THE GROUP\\'S RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n36  \\r\\n\\r\\nSet out below, are the carrying amounts of the Group’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and the movements \\r\\n\\r\\nduring the period: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR  1 January 2019 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nRight-of-use assets 30 693 54 382 \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liability 33 207 57 051 \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial \\r\\n\\r\\nstatements, and the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgements \\r\\n\\r\\nare continually evaluated and are based on management’s experience and other factors, including expectations of \\r\\n\\r\\nfuture events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management also makes certain judgements, \\r\\n\\r\\napart from those involving estimations, in the process of applying the accounting policies. Judgements that have the \\r\\n\\r\\nmost significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements and estimates that can \\r\\n\\r\\ncause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year include. \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognizes the credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The Standard applies a forward-looking expected \\r\\n\\r\\ncredit loss (ECL) approach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans and other \\r\\n\\r\\ndebt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The assets \\r\\n\\r\\nto test for impairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes \\r\\n\\r\\nassets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. In stage 1, the allowances \\r\\n\\r\\nequal the 12-month expected credit loss. Stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit \\r\\n\\r\\nrisk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets. In stage 2 and 3, the allowances equal the lifetime expected credit losses. \\r\\n\\r\\nLoss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for additional category - purchased or \\r\\n\\r\\noriginated credit-impaired assets (POCI) - regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the \\r\\n\\r\\nchoice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. The model applied was not majorly changed during the year. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe inputs and parameters were reviewed as part of regular process.  Elements of the ECL models that are considered \\r\\n\\r\\naccounting judgements and estimates include: \\r\\n\\r\\n evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2;  \\r\\n\\r\\n identification of unlikely to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3; \\r\\n\\r\\n assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, \\r\\n\\r\\nincluding the various formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\r\\n the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given \\r\\n\\r\\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\r\\n determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;  \\r\\n\\r\\n estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n37  \\r\\n\\r\\noptimistic and pessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;  \\r\\n\\r\\n estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and \\r\\n\\r\\nassigning probabilities to those scenarios; \\r\\n\\r\\n setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlease refer to Note 12. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures \\r\\n\\r\\nrequired in the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with the Luminor Bank AS annual \\r\\n\\r\\nfinancial statements as at 31 December 2018.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall improvements have been performed in the risk management framework, including governance, risk appetite, \\r\\n\\r\\nlimits and documentation since the end of the year 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\n4.

The swaps are being used to hedge interest rate risk exposure that is created by the \\r\\n\\r\\nissued bonds. Trade date for EUR 200 million and EUR 150 million interest swap agreements is 10 October 2018, \\r\\n\\r\\neffective date is 18 October 2018 and maturity date is 18 October 2021. For EUR 300 million interest swap agreement \\r\\n\\r\\ntrade date is 11 June 2019, effective date is 21 June 2019 and maturity date 21 October 2022. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instruments as the terms of the interest \\r\\n\\r\\nrate swaps match the terms of the fixed rate bond (i.e. notional amount, maturity and payment). The Group has \\r\\n\\r\\nestablished a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships, as the underlying risk of the interest rate swaps is \\r\\n\\r\\nidentical to the hedged risk component. To test hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method \\r\\n\\r\\nand compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument against the changes in the fair value of the \\r\\n\\r\\nhedged item attributable to the hedged risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nHedge ineffectiveness can theoretically arise from: \\r\\n\\r\\n A different interest rate curve applied to discount the hedged item and hedging instrument \\r\\n\\r\\n Differences in the timing of cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument, also a different day count \\r\\n\\r\\n The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instrument and \\r\\n\\r\\nhedged item. \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2019 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 650 000 1 898 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial for the period 01 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 350 000 1 128 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial during 2018.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair \\r\\n\\r\\nvalue. Where the fair values of financial assets and liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be \\r\\n\\r\\nderived from active markets, they are determined in a way that unobservable inputs used to measure fair value would \\r\\n\\r\\nreflect the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing assets and liabilities, including assumptions \\r\\n\\r\\nabout the risk. Where observable market data is not available, expert judgment is required to establish fair values. For \\r\\n\\r\\nthe purposes of current financial statements, the above mentioned techniques related to unobservable inputs were \\r\\n\\r\\nnot used as no such financial assets and liabilities exist on the statement of financial position of the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTIZED COST \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR \\r\\nCarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value  \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value  \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortized cost     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and Balances with Central banks 2 924 019 2 924 019 3 293 090 3 293 090 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 141 645 141 645 185 346 185 346 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n49  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 10 222 547 11 431 020 11 472 138 11 484 286 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 13 288 211 14 496 684 14 950 574 14 962 722 \\r\\n\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions  980 692 980 692 3 939 396 3 906 454 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 10 235 443 10 235 443 9 069 885 9 098 414 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 651 716 653 967 351 235 353 233 \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liabilities 57 051 57 051 0 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 45 303 45 303  27 914    27 914    \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 11 970 205 11 972 456 13 388 430 13 386 015  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarises the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities \\r\\n\\r\\naccounted for at fair value. Financial instruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value: \\r\\n\\r\\n Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access \\r\\n\\r\\nat the measurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and \\r\\n\\r\\nshall be used without adjustment to measure fair value whenever available. \\r\\n\\r\\n Level 2 — valuation techniques for which inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 are observable \\r\\n\\r\\nfor the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a \\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 2 input must be observable for a substantial part of the term of the asset or liability.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Level 3 — valuation techniques for which inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs \\r\\n\\r\\nshall be used to measure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing \\r\\n\\r\\nfor situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from \\r\\n\\r\\nthe perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs \\r\\n\\r\\nshall reflect the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including \\r\\n\\r\\nassumptions about the risk.

value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be \\r\\n\\r\\nrealized at the same price in an orderly transaction.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Due from other credit institutions – The fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at \\r\\n\\r\\nthe same price in an orderly transaction. Due from other credit institutions are demand deposits. \\r\\n\\r\\n Loans to customers – Fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows with the base curve \\r\\n\\r\\nused by the Bank (6m Euribor curve as average for all loans). \\r\\n\\r\\n Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (debt securities):  \\r\\n\\r\\n• For domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be \\r\\n\\r\\nthe priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading offers in the form of prices, yields \\r\\n\\r\\nor equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid prices shall be used \\r\\n\\r\\ntaking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no \\r\\n\\r\\nquotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are \\r\\n\\r\\nclearly incorrect or artificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data \\r\\n\\r\\nusing sources like Bloomberg or similar.  \\r\\n\\r\\n• The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the \\r\\n\\r\\ninterest rates for items with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured using \\r\\n\\r\\nthe assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market \\r\\n\\r\\nparticipants act in their economic best interest. \\r\\n\\r\\n Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (equities, debt securities):  \\r\\n\\r\\n• The quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source for local equities. These are securities \\r\\n\\r\\nfor which active market exists based on the turnover, meaning availability of quotes at which market \\r\\n\\r\\nparticipants transact in the local stock market. The quotes of foreign equities shall be taken from Bloomberg \\r\\n\\r\\ngiving the priority to the primary market, and then to the country of issuer if the active market exists there. \\r\\n\\r\\nOtherwise, the market with the highest liquidity (turnover) shall be used as a source for pricing. If the quotes \\r\\n\\r\\nin primary data sources are clearly incorrect or artificial, the price of particular equity shall be derived from \\r\\n\\r\\nliquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or similar. Correctness of the quotes described above are \\r\\n\\r\\nthe subject of expert judgment of the Market and Liquidity Risk Management Department member together \\r\\n\\r\\nwith the Bank’s Markets Department’s dealer responsible for equity trading.

Alternatively, dividend discount model shall be used to determine \\r\\n\\r\\nthe price of equity. Expert opinion based on other available related market data shall be used for pricing of \\r\\n\\r\\nequity if the previously described methods are not possible. \\r\\n\\r\\n• For domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be \\r\\n\\r\\nthe priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading offers in the form of prices, \\r\\n\\r\\nyields or equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid prices shall \\r\\n\\r\\nbe used taking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there \\r\\n\\r\\nare no quotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers \\r\\n\\r\\nare clearly incorrect or artificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market \\r\\n\\r\\ndata using sources like Bloomberg or similar. \\r\\n\\r\\n• The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using \\r\\n\\r\\nthe interest rates for items with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured \\r\\n\\r\\nusing the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market \\r\\n\\r\\nparticipants act in their economic best interest. \\r\\n\\r\\n Derivative financial instruments – Market data from financial data vendors, electronic trading platforms or third-\\r\\n\\r\\nparty valuation are used for valuation purposes. The derivatives represent non-complex products valued with \\r\\n\\r\\ngenerally accepted models. Valuation inputs are derived from the market data. \\r\\n\\r\\n Loans and deposits from credit institutions – The fair value of loans equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the \\r\\n\\r\\nloans from credit institutions is under market conditions. Expected cash flows of the liabilities from the banks are \\r\\n\\r\\ndiscounted with the same market rates as loans. Loans from credit institutions are long-term. Deposits from credit \\r\\n\\r\\ninstitutions are demand deposits. The fair value of deposits equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the deposits \\r\\n\\r\\nfrom credit institutions is under market conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Deposits from customers – The gross carrying amount of demand deposits as a fair value is applied as an \\r\\n\\r\\napproximation due to very short maturities. \\r\\n\\r\\n Debt securities issued – The debt securities issued by the Bank are initially recognized at fair value less transaction \\r\\n\\r\\ncosts and are subsequently carried at amortized cost using effective interest rate (EIR) method. The fair value is \\r\\n\\r\\ncalculated by discounting the future cash flows using the market interest rate yield curve. \\r\\n\\r\\n20.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating Decision Maker (CODM) as required by IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as Management \\r\\n\\r\\nBoard. The Management Board monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of \\r\\n\\r\\nmaking decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based \\r\\n\\r\\non profit before tax and is measured consistently with profit before tax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest \\r\\n\\r\\nincome is reported net of expenses after internal funds transfer pricing, as management primarily relies on net interest \\r\\n\\r\\nrevenue across product categories as a performance measure. Fees and commission income for segment performance \\r\\n\\r\\nis also reported net of expenses and split is made between different product categories for segment reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the \\r\\n\\r\\nCODM. Corporate Banking segment services business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager. Retail \\r\\n\\r\\nBanking segment services business customers without a dedicated relationship manager and private individuals not \\r\\n\\r\\nbelonging to Wealth Management segment. Wealth Management services wealthy private individuals and holding \\r\\n\\r\\ncompanies associated with those individuals. Results of other operating segments are included in Other segment. \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective \\r\\n\\r\\nsegments (including internal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Unallocated segment) and \\r\\n\\r\\nincome and expenses not booked on customer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using \\r\\n\\r\\ninternally agreed allocation mechanisms. Only assets and liabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating \\r\\n\\r\\nsegments are reported under the respective segments, all other balance sheet items are reported under Other segment. \\r\\n\\r\\nStarting from 2019, new operating model got implemented in Luminor Group and CODM started monitoring operating \\r\\n\\r\\nsegments on the new basis (as described above). Restatement was made for historic periods for comparability. In June \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 it was decided to transfer customers with leasing exposures but without a relationship to bank entities from \\r\\n\\r\\nRetail segment to segment Other.  \\r\\n\\r\\n

In addition, the Group adheres to the \\r\\nAnnual Accounts Act for Credit Institutions and Securities Companies and the Financial Supervisory Authority \\r\\nregulations (FFFS 2008:25) and RFR1 Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups. The Parent information has \\r\\nbeen prepared in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554) and with application of the \\r\\nSwedish Financial Reporting Boards RFR 2 Accounting for legal entities. The condensed interim financial \\r\\ninformation do not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and \\r\\nshould be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual financial statements as at 31 December 2017. \\r\\n \\r\\nComparative figures for the Group are the same ones as disclosed for the Parent due to the fact that the merge of \\r\\nNordea and DNB Baltic businesses was done on 1st October 2017. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed interim financial information are consistent \\r\\nwith those followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December \\r\\n2017, except for the estimation of income tax and new accounting standards which came into force from 1 \\r\\nJanuary 2018 and are described below. \\r\\n \\r\\nIncome tax expense is recognised based on management’s estimate of the weighted average effective annual \\r\\nincome tax rate expected for the full financial year.  \\r\\n \\r\\nChanges in accounting policies \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 9 as issued by the IASB in July 2014 with a date of adoption of January 2018, \\r\\nwhich resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the \\r\\nfinancial statements. The Group did not early adopt any of IFRS 9 in previous periods. \\r\\n \\r\\nAs permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group elected not to restate comparative figures. Any \\r\\nadjustement to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in \\r\\nthe opening retained earnings of the current period. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in accounting policies for recognition, classification and \\r\\nmeasurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets.  \\r\\n \\r\\nClassification and measurement \\r\\n\\r\\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component \\r\\n(determined in accordance with IFRS 15) at their transaction price. Other financial assets and financial liabilities \\r\\nare measured at initial recognition at their fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial \\r\\nliability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or \\r\\nissue of the financial asset or financial liability. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent measurement of financial assets depends on the classification performed by the Group at initial \\r\\nrecognition. At initial recognition, financial assets can be classified into one of the following categories: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets measured at amortised cost. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nClassification is performed based on both the Group’s business model for managing financial assets and the \\r\\ncharacteristics of contractual cash flows of the financial assets. However, financial assets that meet the amortised \\r\\n\\r\\ncost or fair value through other comprehensive income measurement criteria, may be designated on initial \\r\\nrecognition by the Group to fair value through profit or loss measurement option, provided that particular \\r\\n\\r\\nqualifying criteria are met. Additionally, the Group may make an irrevocable election at initial recognition for \\r\\nparticular investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value through profit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\nto present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. \\r\\nOn initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified into one of the following categories: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Group AB \\r\\nINTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION \\r\\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2018  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n(all amounts are in EUR thousand, if not otherwise stated) \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPage 17 of 35 \\r\\n\\r\\nACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (continued \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nFinancial liability is classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss if: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 It meets the definition of held for trading and \\r\\n\\uf0b7 It is designated upon initial recognition to fair value through profit or loss measurement option. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll other financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment of financial assets \\r\\nIFRS 9 fundamentally changed the credit loss recognition methodology. The standard replaced IAS 39’s incurred \\r\\nloss approach with a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. The Bank is required to recognize an \\r\\nallowance for expected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan \\r\\ncommitments and financial guarantee contracts. The allowance is based on the expected credit losses associated \\r\\nwith the probability of default in the next twelve months unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk \\r\\nsince origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the probability of default over the life of the asset. Loss \\r\\nallowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for purchased or originated credit-\\r\\nimpaired assets (POCI) regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument. The Bank has \\r\\nestablished a policy to perform an assessment at the end of each reporting period of whether credit risk has \\r\\nincreased significantly since initial recognition by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the \\r\\nremaining life of the financial instrument.  \\r\\n \\r\\nThe assets to test for impairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  \\r\\nStage 1 includes assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk or which are classified as low \\r\\nrisk (rating categorised as “Investment grade” or higher), stage 2 includes assets where there has been a \\r\\nsignificant increase in credit risk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets. Significant assets in stage 3 are tested for \\r\\nimpairment on an individual basis, while for insignificant assets a collective assessment is performed. In stage 1, \\r\\nthe allowances equal the 12 month expected credit loss. In stage 2 and 3, the allowances equal the lifetime \\r\\nexpected credit losses.  \\r\\n \\r\\nOne important driver for size of allowances under IFRS 9 is the trigger for transferring an asset from Stage 1 to \\r\\nStage 2. Luminor has decided to use a mix of absolute and relative changes (0.6 p.p. and 2.5 times) in 12 month \\r\\npoint-in-time Probability of Default (PD) to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. \\r\\nIn addition, customers with forbearance measures, included in watch list and contracts with payments more than \\r\\nthirty days past due are also transferred to Stage 2. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe agreed IFRS 9 impairment methodology is documented in internal procedures, applied in daily life, integration \\r\\ninto front office business processes follows and is intended to be finalized during the year 2018, but this does not \\r\\nimpact impairment calculation.  In general, IFRS 9 impairment model results in earlier recognition of credit losses \\r\\nfor the respective items and increases the amount of loss allowances recognised for these items. Moreover, the \\r\\nimpairment calculations under IFRS 9 are more volatile and pro-cyclical than under IAS 39, mainly due to the \\r\\nsignificant subjectivity applied in the forward looking scenarios. IFRS 9 impairment requirements are applied \\r\\nretrospectively, with transition impact recognized in retained earnings as at 1 January 2018.  \\r\\n \\r\\nCapital management \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new expected loss approach model had a negative impact on the Bank’s regulatory capital. Upon the \\r\\ndecision of the Board of Directors  of Luminor Group AB the Bank did not apply transitional arrangements allowed \\r\\nby EU Regulation 2017/23951 and recognised the full effect of the implementation of IFRS 9 from 1 January \\r\\n2018. The capital adequacy ratio is still significantly above the regulatory minimum and in line with the internal \\r\\nRisk Appetite statement. \\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n                                                           \\r\\n1 EU Regulation 2017/2395 amends the CRR by introducing Art. 473a on transitional arrangements for mitigating the impact of \\r\\nthe introduction of IFRS 9 on own funds \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Group AB \\r\\nINTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION \\r\\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2018  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n(all amounts are in EUR thousand, if not otherwise stated) \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPage 18 of 35 \\r\\n\\r\\nACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (continued) \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nImpact of the adoption of IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nSet out below are disclosures relating to the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the Group. \\r\\n \\r\\nClassification and measurement of financial instruments \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement category and the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 \\r\\nand IFRS 9 at January 2018 are compared as follows: \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets Original measurement \\r\\ncategory under IAS 39 \\r\\n\\r\\nNew measurement \\r\\ncategory under IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nIAS 39 carrying \\r\\namount 31 \\r\\nDecember \\r\\n\\r\\n2017 \\r\\n\\r\\nNew carrying \\r\\namount under \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS9 1 January \\r\\n2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with \\r\\ncentral banks \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables Amortised cost 2 620 838 2 620 838 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to credit institutions Loans and receivables Amortised cost 409 506 409 458 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest-bearing securities \\r\\neligible as collateral with \\r\\ncentral banks \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value through profit or \\r\\nloss \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value through profit \\r\\nor loss/ Fair value \\r\\nthrough other \\r\\ncomprehensive income \\r\\n\\r\\n164 202 164 202 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial \\r\\ninstruments \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value through profit or \\r\\nloss \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value through profit \\r\\nor loss \\r\\n\\r\\n27 753 27 753 \\r\\n\\r\\nInvestments in managed \\r\\npension funds \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at FVTPL Financial assets at \\r\\nFVTPL \\r\\n\\r\\n4 526 4 526 \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments Available for sale/ \\r\\nFinancial assets at FVTPL \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value through other \\r\\ncomprehensive income \\r\\n\\r\\n5 830 5 830 \\r\\n\\r\\nBonds and other interest-\\r\\nbearing securities \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and \\r\\nreceivables/Investmets \\r\\nheld to maturity \\r\\n\\r\\nAmortised cost 34 357 34 357 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to public Loans and receivables Amortised cost 11 646 540 11 603 290 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nDebt securities held for liquidity purposes were designated to FVTPL (under fair value option) because of \\r\\naccounting mismatch.

IFRS 15 establishes a five-step \\r\\nmodel that will apply to revenue earned from a contract with a customer (with limited exceptions), regardless of \\r\\nthe type of revenue transaction or the industry. The standard’s requirements also apply to the recognition and \\r\\nmeasurement of gains and losses on the sale of some non-financial assets that are not an output of the entity’s \\r\\nordinary activities (e.g., sales of property, plant and equipment or intangibles). Extensive disclosures will be \\r\\nrequired, including disaggregation of total revenue; information about performance obligations; changes in \\r\\ncontract asset and liability account balances between periods and key judgments and estimates. Management \\r\\nhas assessed that the application of the standard did not have any effect on the Bank and the Group financial \\r\\nstatements.  \\r\\n  \\r\\nThe core principle of IFRS 15 is that revenue must be recognised to reflect the transfer of services to customers \\r\\nat an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for such services. This \\r\\ncore principle is applied through a five-step model: \\r\\n\\r\\n1) Identify the contract with the customer,  \\r\\n2) Identify the performance obligation in the contract, \\r\\n3) Determine the transaction price, \\r\\n4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract, \\r\\n5) Recognise revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFor each performance obligation identified the Group determines at contract inception whether it satisfies the \\r\\nperformance obligation over time or at a point in time, whether the consideration is fixed or variable, including \\r\\nwhether consideration is constrained due to external factors. Consideration is subsequently allocated to the \\r\\nidentified performance obligation.  \\r\\n \\r\\nFor services provided over time, consideration is recognised when the service is provided to the customer \\r\\nassuming that a significant reversal of consideration will not occur. Examples of income earned for services \\r\\nsatisfied over time include the fee income earned for the asset management services.  \\r\\n \\r\\nIf a performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time then the income is recognised when the service is \\r\\ntransferred to the customer. Examples of such income include fee income for executing transactions (clearing and \\r\\nsettlement, customers’ securities trading, payment cards transaction fees). \\r\\n \\r\\nIFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Clarifications) \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Clarifications apply for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. \\r\\nThe objective of the Clarifications is to clarify the IASB’s intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15 \\r\\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers, particularly the accounting of identifying performance obligations \\r\\namending the wording of the “separately identifiable” principle, of principal versus agent considerations including \\r\\nthe assessment of whether an entity is a principal or an agent as well as applications of control principle and of \\r\\nlicensing providing additional guidance for accounting of intellectual property and royalties. The Clarifications also \\r\\nprovide additional practical expedients for entities that either apply IFRS 15 fully retrospectively or that elect to \\r\\napply the modified retrospective approach. As described above, management has assessed that the application \\r\\nof the standard did not have any material effect on the Bank and the Group financial statements. \\r\\n \\r\\nIFRS 16 Leases \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases as of January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, \\r\\nmeasurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single \\r\\non-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17. The standard includes two \\r\\nrecognition exemptions for lessees – leases of ’low-value’ assets (e.g., personal computers) and short-term \\r\\nleases (i.e., leases with a lease term of 12 months or less).  \\r\\n \\r\\nAt the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments (i.e., the lease \\r\\nliability) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e., the right-of-use \\r\\nasset). Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the \\r\\ndepreciation expense on the right-of-use asset. Lessees will be also required to remeasure the lease liability upon \\r\\nthe occurrence of certain events (e.g., a change in the lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting \\r\\nfrom a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments). The lessee will generally recognise the \\r\\namount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. \\r\\n \\r\\nIn 2018, the Group will continue to assess the potential effect of IFRS 16 on its consolidated financial statements. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Group AB \\r\\nINTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION \\r\\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2018  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n(all amounts are in EUR thousand, if not otherwise stated) \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPage 22 of 35 \\r\\n\\r\\nRISK MANAGEMENT \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and \\r\\ndisclosures required in the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with the Group's \\r\\nannual financial statements as at 31 December 2017.  \\r\\n \\r\\nThere have been no major changes in the risk management or in any risk management policies since the year \\r\\nend. \\r\\n \\r\\nKey judgments, inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used to assessing expected credit losses. \\r\\n \\r\\nWith the adoption of IFRS 9 three stages model was introduced: \\r\\nStage 1 – part of the portfolio for which no significant deterioration in credit quality has occurred since initial \\r\\nrecognition (or the exposure is of low credit risk) and the financial instrument is not considered credit-impaired; \\r\\nStage 2 – part of the portfolio for which significant deterioration in credit quality has occurred since initial \\r\\nrecognition, evidenced by the SICR – significant increase in credit risk - indicator, and the financial instrument is \\r\\nnot considered credit-impaired; \\r\\nStage 3 – credit-impaired part of the portfolio. Luminor equates default and credit-impairment definitions so that all \\r\\ndefaulted exposures are treated as credit-impaired and all credit-impaired exposures are treated as defaulted. \\r\\nThis approach is based on the fact that the default definition used by Luminor covers all events indicated by IFRS \\r\\n9 as possible evidence that financial instrument is credit-impaired and all of these events are considered by \\r\\nLuminor as having a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows from the instrument. \\r\\nAdditional category is POCI financial assets - financial assets that were purchased or originated as credit-\\r\\nimpaired. POCI assets are subject to unchanging classification, i.e. financial asset once classified as POCI \\r\\nremains in this group until derecognized. The POCI classification is determined at financial instrument level. \\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor applies low credit risk exemption to the following classes of exposures: \\r\\n\\uf0b7 central governments, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 central bank, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 regional governments, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 local authorities and \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 institutions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe counterparty must fulfil the condition of having credit rating indicating investment grade. \\r\\n \\r\\nGenerally the financial asset is treated as facing significant increase in credit risk if at least one of the following \\r\\nSICR indicators is identified after initial recognition of the financial instrument and was not present as of its \\r\\norigination: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Significant increase of 12-month PD – significant increase of point-in-time (PIT) forward-looking 12-month \\r\\n\\r\\nPD since initial recognition until reporting date (2.5 times and 0.6 p.p. jointly), \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Risk grade 9 or 10 – risk grade 9 or 10 as of reporting date, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 30 days past due – more than 30 days past due as of reporting date, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Forborne performing – forborne performing status as of reporting date (forbearance not triggering non-\\r\\n\\r\\nperforming status) in accordance with FINREP instruction reporting requirements, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Watch list – watch list status as of reporting date. \\r\\nAll of the SICR indicators are recognized at financial instrument level in order to track changes in credit risk since \\r\\ninitial recognition date for particular financial instrument, even though some of them refer to the customer’s \\r\\ncharacteristics. \\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor identifies default when either or both of the following default indicators have taken place:  \\r\\n1. The customer is past due more than 90 days on any material obligation to the Luminor;  \\r\\n2. The customer is considered unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Luminor.  \\r\\nFor exposure to banks the default is recognized when payments are due more than 7 days. \\r\\nFor the purpose of unlikeliness to pay identification, elements taken as indications of unlikeliness to pay include \\r\\nthe following: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Distressed restructuring of credit obligation (forbearance triggering non-performing status in accordance with \\r\\n\\r\\nFINREP instruction requirements);  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Major financial problems of the customer (present or expected), i.e. significant financial difficulties; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Recognition of specific credit risk adjustment resulting from a significant decline in credit quality of the \\r\\n\\r\\nexposure; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Bankruptcy of the customer or similar protection; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Group AB \\r\\nINTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION \\r\\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2018  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n(all amounts are in EUR thousand, if not otherwise stated) \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPage 23 of 35 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Disappearance of an active market for a financial asset because of financial difficulties of the customer; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Sell of credit obligation at material credit-related economic loss; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Credit fraud; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 External rating indicating default. \\r\\nThe default is recognised on customer level. \\r\\nReturn to a non-defaulted status is possible not earlier than after 3 months when all default triggers cease to be \\r\\nmet. During these 3 months of the probation period the timely payments by a customer should be ensured. The \\r\\nexemption from the general rule of probation is the distressed restructuring where at least 1 year needs to pass \\r\\nsince the moment of extending restructuring measures and the moment when a customer is deemed to have an \\r\\nability to comply with the post-restructuring conditions. This approach is consistent with FINREP instruction \\r\\nrequirements for cure of forborne non-performing exposures. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the shift from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 approach incurred loss model was replaced by expected credit loss (ECL) \\r\\nmodel. For Stage 1 financial assets loss allowances equal to 12-month ECL while for Stage 2 and Stage 3 \\r\\nfinancial instruments lifetime ECL is calculated.  \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Purchased or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) financial assets ECL is estimated in the lifetime horizon till \\r\\nthe maturity. The loss expected at initial recognition is referred to as Initial impairment. At subsequent periods \\r\\nonly the cumulative changes in the lifetime expected credit losses, since initial recognition, are recognised in profit \\r\\nor loss. Collective assessment of impairment is performed for all financial instruments that are not defaulted as of \\r\\nthe reporting date, i.e. are classified to either Stage 1 or Stage 2 or are non-defaulted POCI asset. The expected \\r\\nloss is calculated as probability weighted average of losses expected in different macroeconomic scenarios. \\r\\nExpected loss in concrete macroeconomic scenario is calculated as the multiple of probability of default (PD), loss \\r\\ngiven default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and cumulative prepayment rate and is discounted using effective \\r\\ninterest rate. PD curves, LGD curves and EAD curves are estimated for all months until the maturity date of the \\r\\nfacility. If the facility is classified to Stage 1, expected losses are estimated over the period of up to 12 months. If \\r\\nthe facility is classified to Stage 2 then the expected loss is estimated over the period up to maturity date of the \\r\\nfacility. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nEstimation of PD and LGD curves take into account forward looking macroeconomic information. Methodology of \\r\\nestimation of these risk parameters includes modelling of the relationship between risk parameters and \\r\\nmacroeconomic variables. Forecasts of macroeconomic variables under different scenarios for 3 upcoming years \\r\\ntogether with scenario probabilities are prepared by Luminor macroeconomists. Three macroeconomic scenarios \\r\\nare considered: baseline/realistic, positive, and pessimistic scenario (with the probability weights of 60 %, 25 % \\r\\nand 15 % respectively). Macroeconomic scenarios that are prepared for the estimation of expected losses are \\r\\nconsistent with scenarios which are used in credit risk stress testing process. Macroeconomic variables that are \\r\\nincluded in the modelling are annual change in real GDP, unemployment rate and annual change of residential \\r\\nreal estate price. Starting from the fourth year it is assumed that risk parameters (PD and LGD) converge to their \\r\\nlong term average levels. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stage 3 exposures (or defaulted POCI assets), which are classified as material, Luminor evaluates \\r\\nthe impairment amount on individual basis (individual assessment) under discounted cash flows (DCF) method. \\r\\nTwo scenarios – base case and risk case – are used. For exceptional cases usage of one scenario can be \\r\\nsufficient. The circumstances when only one scenario might be acceptable could be the deep workout case or the \\r\\ncase when total exposure of defaulted borrower falls below the materiality threshold. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stage 3 exposures (or defaulted POCI assets), which are classified as immaterial, Luminor evaluates \\r\\nthe impairment amount on collective basis (collective assessment). Impairment is calculated applying the pool \\r\\nrate for unsecured part. Different pool rates are applied for these pools distinguished by Luminor: \\r\\n\\uf0b7 mortgage loans and private credits to private individuals, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 consumer loans and other loans to private individuals (including leasing), \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 SMEs (all financial instruments to legal entities). \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Group AB \\r\\nINTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION \\r\\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2018  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n(all amounts are in EUR thousand, if not otherwise stated) \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPage 24 of 35 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nG1.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued) \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nFinancial instruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value: \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \\r\\n \\r\\nLevel 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value     \\r\\nmeasurement is directly or indirectly observable. \\r\\n  \\r\\nLevel 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value \\r\\nmeasurement is unobservable. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe fair value of all Bank contracted derivatives  is defined as level 2. These are interest rate swaps and in all \\r\\ncases pricing is based on market observable inputs. For assets and liabilities that are recognized at fair value on a \\r\\nrecurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-\\r\\nassessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a \\r\\nwhole) at the end of each reporting period. There were no movement of securities between the levels during 2018. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of shares on level 3 are as follows: \\r\\nconversion rate, average trading price, liquidity discount. \\r\\n \\r\\nPrinciples for information about the fair values of financial instruments which are carried at amortised cost \\r\\n\\r\\nFor assets and liabilities not carried at fair value book value is estimated to be a reasonable approximation of fair \\r\\nvalue. Where the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial \\r\\nposition cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that \\r\\ninclude the use of mathematical models. The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data \\r\\nwhere possible, but where observable market data is not available, judgment is required to establish fair values.  \\r\\nThe fair value of loans to customers, customer deposits, amounts due from credit institutions and amounts due to \\r\\ncredit institutions and other financial assets and liabilities, obligations under finance leases is estimated by \\r\\ndiscounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining \\r\\nmaturities. \\r\\n \\r\\nIn assessing the fair value for financial assets, the management has performed discounted cash flow analysis; up-\\r\\nto-date market information at assessment moment is being used for assessing cash flows. For loans, where base \\r\\ninterest rates are pegged to floating market interest rates, the Group has considered difference between average \\r\\ninterest margin of issued loans and average interest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan \\r\\nportfolio this margin has not been changed (increased) since issuance, the Group has estimated that for such \\r\\nloans the carrying value is considered equal to fair value. \\r\\nFair value of financial liabilities at amortized cost such as Loans and deposits from credit institutions and Deposits \\r\\nfrom customers which are not on demand have been estimated based on discounted cash flow model using \\r\\ninterest rates for similar products as at period end. Fair value of those financial liabilities that are on demand or \\r\\nhave floating interest rate have been estimated to be approximately equal to its carrying amount. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe table below summarizes the fair values of financial assets and liabilities recognized at amortized cost in the \\r\\nstatement of financial position instruments: \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 June 2018 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets        \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to credit institutions  107 475 42 555 150 030 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to the public   11 717 276 11 717 276 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total \\r\\n\\r\\nDue to credit institutions  1 669 657 2 718 363 4 388 020 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost   1 637 749 6 658 918 8 296 667 \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Group AB \\r\\nINTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION \\r\\nFOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 JUNE 2018  \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n(all amounts are in EUR thousand, if not otherwise stated) \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPage 32 of 35 \\r\\n\\r\\nG 11.

EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD    35\\r\\n\\r\\nCONTACT DETAILS    36\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT\\r\\nOverview\\r\\nLuminor was established on 1 October 2017 as a result of the merger of DNB Bank ASA (Commercial Register no. 984 851 006) and \\r\\nNordea Bank AB (Swedish Commercial Register no. 516406-0120) operations in the Baltic countries to create a new-generation \\r\\nfinancial service provider for local businesses and financially active people. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest financial services provider in the Baltics, with ca 1.1 million clients, ca 3,000 employees, 16% market \\r\\nshare in deposits and 22% market share in lending. Total shareholder equity of Luminor amounts to 1.8 billion euros and is \\r\\ncapitalised at CET1 17.3%. Luminor’s vision is to become the best financial ecosystem for its customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, an agreement was signed between DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank AB with US-based private equity firm \\r\\nBlackstone to sell the majority stake in Luminor. As part of the transaction, Blackstone will acquire a 60% majority stake in the \\r\\nbank. Nordea and DNB will retain equal 20% equity stakes in Luminor and will continue to support the bank with long term funding, \\r\\nexpertise and ongoing representation on the Board of Directors. Additionally, Blackstone has entered into an agreement with \\r\\nNordea to purchase their remaining 20% stake over the coming years. Closing of the transaction is subject to European Central \\r\\nBank’s and local supervisory authorities’ approvals and is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis transaction represents the largest majority-stake acquisition of a universal bank by private equity in the last decade globally, \\r\\nand one of the largest M&A transactions in Baltic history.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (or “Luminor Estonia”) offers a wide range of products and services to its customers in all channels, digital and \\r\\nphysical, with headquarters in Tallinn and 10 offices in Tartu, Pärnu, Viljandi, Rakvere and Jõhvi, in addition a cashless advisory \\r\\ndesk in Kuressaare. Luminor has a total of 100 ATMs throughout Estonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of Q3 2018, Luminor Estonia employed ca 700 full-time employees and served ca 139,000 clients in the private and \\r\\nbusiness segments, with a market share of 17% in lending and 10% in deposits, making it the third-largest financial service provider \\r\\non the market. Luminor Estonia’s capital ratio at the end of Q3 2018 in Estonia was 18.09% Common Equity Tier 1 capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Estonia has five subsidiaries: Luminor Liising AS, which provides leasing for vehicles, heavy equipment and other assets; \\r\\nLuminor Pensions Estonia AS, which focuses on growing the pension assets of clients; Luminor Kindlustusmaakler OÜ, which \\r\\nprovides insurance broker services; and Promano OÜ and Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ, which provide asset management services. \\r\\n\\r\\nMoody’s has assigned first time long- and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, as well as a local \\r\\ncurrency long-term (P)Baa2 senior MTN rating to Luminor Bank AS.\\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview\\r\\nAs expected, Estonia’s economic momentum has marginally moderated in Q2 2018 to 3.7% y/y from the exceptionally brisk pace \\r\\nseen at the end of last year (5% y/y in Q4). As a key positive development, export growth has picked up speed in Q2 after a weak start \\r\\nto the year. However, the key drag resulted from investments. In terms of industry branches, the most substantial contributions \\r\\nto growth came from construction and the export-orientated manufacturing sector, followed by science and technology and the \\r\\npivotal ICT (Information And Communication Technology) branches. As expected, consumers’ appetite remains rather stable on \\r\\nthe back of strong labour markets. Consumers have not really opted to spend the extra income received from the past taxation \\r\\nreform (which effectively increased the non-taxable income). \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia’s underlying growth is expected to continue to be broad-based with cyclical indicators in the domestic and external sectors \\r\\n(including economic and consumer confidence) pointing to momentum carrying over into H2. Manufacturing value added growth \\r\\nhas continued at a healthy single-digit pace with stable export orders complemented by strong domestic demand. Estonia’s open \\r\\neconomy is highly integrated with the economies of the euro area and the Nordic countries, and will continue to develop hand in \\r\\nhand with them. The three key trade partners: Finland, Sweden and Germany represent 40% of Estonia’s direct exports. Economic \\r\\ngrowth in the medium term will depend more on investments in productivity, since the increase in employment will be contained \\r\\nand a more moderate growth pace is also expected in the external markets. Only gradual moderation of current strong growth is \\r\\nforeseen for next year as the economy faces headwinds in the external sector.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the risks to the 3.5% y/y growth forecast for 2018 remain rather balanced as rising capacity constraints and new flow of EU \\r\\nstructural funds are expected to contribute to gradual recovery in investments. With a solid growth outlook and unemployment at \\r\\napprox. 6% in H1, households remain confident about their future economic prospects. Consumer appetite for major purchases \\r\\nremains at a high level, supporting the outlook for the residential real estate market, which has seen stable demand and close to \\r\\neuro-area-average price increases.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivities\\r\\nDuring Q3 2018, Luminor continued with the legal aspects of its merger, which will see the full integration of the banks, continuing \\r\\noperations in all three Baltic States through the Estonian bank and its registered branches in Latvia and Lithuania. In May 2018, \\r\\nLuminor received confirmation from the European Central Bank that the branches in Latvia and Lithuania could be established \\r\\nand commence operations. The cross border merger and legal change is expected to take place starting from 2 January 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n4\\r\\n\\r\\nHousehold segment\\r\\nLuminor’s brand value lies in its close relationship with its customers and services. By the end of Q3 2018, Luminor Estonia \\r\\nhad approximately 116,000 household clients. Average lending and deposit volumes remained stable. Delivering good customer \\r\\nexperiences and meeting our customers’ needs are essential to Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is continuing to automate and digitalise products and services to meet customers’ needs and expectations. The majority \\r\\nof meetings with our clients and active client communication go through remote channels. Starting from 1 July 2018, all bank cards \\r\\nfor day-to-day operations are renewed automatically and sent conveniently to customers by post.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur goal is to become the home bank for our target customers by offering professional advice and excellent customer service. \\r\\nDuring Q3 2018, Luminor Estonia household segment focused on activation of home bank customer transactions. We want our \\r\\ncustomers to actively use Luminor bank cards and be more active in terms of their daily financial operations. This goal was \\r\\nsupported by Luminor’s card activation campaign aimed at customers who already have a bank card.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking segment\\r\\nOur Private Banking customer activities are centred on everyday banking and growing the savings portfolio. We help high net worth \\r\\nindividuals and their families to grow, manage and preserve their wealth. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of Q3, Luminor Estonia had around 1,000 Private Banking customers. Private Banking gained momentum in Q3 2018 with \\r\\npositive growth in deposits area,  resulting in growth of 39 million euros during the third quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Q3 2018, Private Banking focused on strategic positioning and attracting new funding through collaboration with Luminor’s \\r\\nother business segments and marketing to help deliver results. We held a Private Banking customers event on 13 September 2018 \\r\\nwhere we gave insights on upcoming macroeconomic trends.\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness and corporate client segments\\r\\nIn Q3 2018, Luminor Estonia continued to serve its ca 22,000 customers in the corporate and business client segments. Luminor \\r\\nEstonia continued profitable lending growth to small and medium-sized business clients. We have strengthened our position in the \\r\\nagricultural sector and focused on increasing our customer base and customer activity in the business client segment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe activities were supported by regional marketing events and marketing campaign to help to deliver improved customer service \\r\\ntowards business clients.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate client segment results were in line with macroeconomic developments. Lending to large corporations and international \\r\\ncustomers had a positive impact in lending profitability and growth in deposits. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur corporate customers value our tailored financial products and services because they help them to operate efficiently and \\r\\ngrow. In Q3 Luminor Estonia, held its annual customer event to strengthen our relationship with our target customers in the \\r\\nbusiness, corporate and private client segments.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing\\r\\nLeasing services for vehicles, heavy equipment and other assets for private individuals and business clients are provided through \\r\\nthe subsidiary Luminor Liising AS. In Q3 2018, the total leasing portfolio amounted to 947 million euros. Sales were supported \\r\\nthrough active campaigns with vendors and active sales via bank channels to the business and household customer segments.\\r\\n\\r\\nPensions\\r\\nLuminor Estonia continued to provide 2nd and 3rd pillar and employer pension fund management services to its customers \\r\\nthrough its subsidiary Luminor Pensions Estonia AS. Luminor Estonia’s first pension funds celebrated their 10th anniversary on 15 \\r\\nSeptember 2018 with very strong results. Luminor funds topped the 10-year performance chart, outperforming the competition   \\r\\nin both 2nd and 3rd pillar. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of Q3 2018, assets under management had reached 329 million euros increasing by 3.5% compared to Q2 and the \\r\\nnumber of clients grew as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate social responsibility in Luminor\\r\\nWe are creating a new-generation financial services provider because we are determined to build a better tomorrow – for families \\r\\nand businesses and for the communities and countries in which we live and operate. We believe in contributing to the development \\r\\nof the local communities in which we operate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are committed to taking into account corporate governance, social conditions and environment in all of our activities, including \\r\\nproduct and service development, advisory services and sales, investment and credit decisions, and other operations. We do not \\r\\ncontribute to the infringement of human or labour rights, corruption, serious environmental harm or other actions that could be \\r\\nregarded as unethical. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n5\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a responsibility to undertake efforts to ensure that the banking industry delivers ethical products and services, and \\r\\nwe take responsibility for to whom and how the products and services will be offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnti-money laundering related matters\\r\\nAt Luminor, we have zero tolerance towards money laundering and other financial crime risk. Luminor has developed and \\r\\nimplemented a comprehensive set of measures to identify, manage and control its risks. We comply with sanctions laws and follow \\r\\nthe guidelines, recommendations and standards issued by local regulatory and supervisory authorities and relevant international \\r\\norganizations, as well as those issued by local banking associations and financial intelligence units in each Baltic state.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Compliance and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) functions are operating at the pan-Baltic level, having competence centres \\r\\nand highly experienced professionals in the following areas: data protection, AML/ Certified Fraud Examiners (CFT), FATCA, IT \\r\\ncompliance and digital channels, business integrity, bank products & new product development. Luminor’s AML, Compliance and \\r\\nAnti-Financial Crime units employs over 100 professionals, maintaining a robust compliance framework and processes through \\r\\nthe organization.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant events after 30 September 2018\\r\\nLuminor has recently established a Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme, which enables Luminor to issue bonds under \\r\\nstandardized documentation. The programme has two purposes - to replace funding from the owner banks and to support and \\r\\nfund our customer business. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnder this programme, Luminor will be able to issue debt in different sizes and maturities going forward. On 10 October, Luminor \\r\\nissued a 350-million-euro senior unsecured inaugural public bond with a maturity of three years and coupon of 150 bps. The bond \\r\\nwill be listed on the Irish Stock Exchange. The issue was well supported by the Baltic community and international accounts, having \\r\\na total of 46 investors spread over 14 different countries. Bonds were issued by Luminor Bank Estonia, taking into account both the \\r\\nupcoming change in its ownership structure and Luminor’s cross-border merger to become one centralised bank under Estonia \\r\\nwith Latvia and Lithuania as branches starting from January 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 October, Moody´s Investor Service assigned to Luminor Bank a senior unsecured MTN rating of Baa2, which followed the \\r\\nissuance of senior debt within the scope of provisionally rated senior unsecured EMTN program carrying a long-term rating of \\r\\n(P) Baa2. The rationale for the senior unsecured EMTN program rating is explained in the Moody´s Investor Service rating action \\r\\nreleased on 13 September 2018.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOther events\\r\\nMonika Peetson was recalled from Luminor Bank AS Management Board on 11. November 2018. Starting from 12 November 2018, \\r\\nAndrius Nacajus was appointed as a new Member of the Management Board. The Management Board of Luminor Bank AS consists \\r\\nof 3 members elected by the Supervisory Council. As of 12 November 2018, the members are Gunnar Toomemets (chairman), \\r\\nSander Klaos and Andrius Nacajus.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Results\\r\\nThe merger of the Baltic businesses of DNB and Nordea in October 2017 has had a significant impact both on the financial result \\r\\nand operational focus. The consolidated financial information prior to the merger represents consolidated results of DNB’s \\r\\nrespective entities, whereas starting from 1 October 2017, such financial information also reflects the effects of the acquisition of \\r\\nassets and liabilities of Nordea. As a result, comparability of consolidated financial information between January-September 2017 \\r\\nand January-September 2018 is limited in light of the effects of the merger.\\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit earned in Q3 2018 was 7.1 million euros, which was 7.5 million euros less than Q2 2018 mainly due to reversals of \\r\\nimpairment losses on loans, which increased the profit in Q2 2018. Net interest margin remained stable at 1.8%. Net fees and \\r\\ncommission income from both corporate and household clients increased 3% in Q3 2018 compared to Q2 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n6\\r\\n\\r\\nKEY FIGURES*                                                                                            \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR Jan-Sep 2018 Q3 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit 24\\u2009476 7 081\\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity 467\\u2009385 468 998\\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE), % 7.0 6.0\\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets 3\\u2009780\\u2009807 3 943 547\\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA), % 0.9 0.7\\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 53\\u2009206 17 641\\r\\n\\r\\nAVERAGE INTEREST EARNING ASSETS 3\\u2009745\\u2009001 3 904 505\\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM), % 1.9 1.8\\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio (C/I), % 65.0 5 6.7\\r\\n\\r\\n*Quarterly ratios and Jan-Sept 2018 ratios (ROE, ROA, NIM, C/I) have been expressed on an annualized basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nExplanations:\\r\\nAverage equity (belonging to owners of company) = (equity at end of reporting period + equity at end of previous period) / 2\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) = Net profit / Average equity * 100%\\r\\nAverage assets = (assets at end of reporting period + assets at end of previous period) / 2\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) = Net profit / Assets, average * 100\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets = (interest-earning assets at end of reporting period + interest-earning assets at end of previous period) / 2\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) = Net interest income / Interest earning assets, average * 100\\r\\nCost / Income ratio = Total operating expenses / Total net income * 100\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers remained stable at 3.3 billion euros at 30 September 2018.

Long-term funding was committed for 6 years (4+2), beginning from the 1 October \\r\\n2017 when Luminor was established and short-term funding in the form of revolving credit of 364 days. In addition to the current \\r\\noutstanding utilized funding, there is also a committed credit line of 0.92 billion euros in place (not utilized at present). When Luminor \\r\\nattracts wholesale long-term (longer than one year) funding externally, the intent is to amortize an equal amount of parent funding.\\r\\n\\r\\nRating\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, Moody’s assigned first-time deposit ratings to Luminor Bank AS with a stable outlook on long-term deposit \\r\\nratings. The ratings assigned to the bank include the following assessments: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n8\\r\\n\\r\\nRating Moody’s\\r\\n\\r\\nProvisional (P) local currency, long term Senior unsecured (MTN)      Baa2\\r\\n\\r\\nForeign and local currency long-term (LT) bank deposit                       Baa1\\r\\n\\r\\nForeign and local currency short-term (ST) bank deposit                     P-2\\r\\n\\r\\nBaseline Credit Assessment (BCA)                                                                          Ba1\\r\\n\\r\\nAdjusted Baseline Credit Assessment                                                                    Ba1\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal and foreign counterparty risk assessment                                     A3/P-2\\r\\n\\r\\nCounterparty credit risk assessment                                                                  A3/P-2\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 October 2018, Moody’s confirmed a local currency long-term senior unsecured debt rating of Baa2 to Luminor Bank AS (Estonia).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ratings assigned to Luminor Bank AS (Estonia) reflect the forward-looking assessment of the group’s operations as a whole, taking \\r\\ninto account the effects of the future ownership change and merger, which are expected to legally consolidate Luminor Bank AS (Latvia) \\r\\nand Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania), which will be branches of Luminor Bank AS (Estonia) starting from 2 January 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY\\r\\nThe LCR (liquidity coverage ratio) for Luminor Estonia was 162.9% at the end of Q3 2018, according to the Delegated Act’s LCR \\r\\ndefinition.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS \\r\\nIn 2018-2019, an internal corporate restructuring of Luminor Group will take place with the aim of concentrating the entire Baltic \\r\\nbusinesses of Luminor Group in Luminor Bank AS, a credit institution in Estonia; where Luminor Bank AS in Estonia will remain \\r\\nas the surviving entity while Luminor Bank AB in Lithuania and Luminor Bank AS in Latvia will be merged into Luminor Bank AS in \\r\\nEstonia and cease to exist. A cross-border merger would be pursued under Directive (EU) 2017/1132 of the European Parliament \\r\\nand of the Council of 14 June 2017 relating to certain aspects of company law as implemented in Lithuania, Latvia and\\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia, respectively. All assets and liabilities of the respective subsidiaries would, in accordance with the relevant laws, be \\r\\ntransferred into the Luminor Bank AS in Estonia as a matter of universal succession, and each subsidiary will cease to exist as a \\r\\nlegal entity upon registration of the cross-border merger. Following the merger, Luminor Bank AS in Estonia will pursue banking \\r\\nbusiness in Lithuania and Latvia through its branches starting from 2 January 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2018 Luminor received confirmation from the European Central Bank that the branches in Latvia and Lithuania could be \\r\\nestablished and commence operations. On 28 June 2018 Luminor received regulatory approval from the European Central Bank \\r\\nto carry out the cross-border merger.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current interim report, “Bank” (or Luminor Bank AS) refers to Luminor Bank AS. “Group” refers to the consolidated financial \\r\\nstatements of Luminor Bank AS and its subsidiaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 September 2018 Bank owned the following subsidiaries:\\r\\n • Luminor Liising AS (leasing and factoring activities),\\r\\n • Luminor Pensions Estonia AS (management of funds),\\r\\n • Promano Est OÜ (real estate management),\\r\\n • Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ (real estate management),\\r\\n • Luminor Kindlustusmaakler OÜ (insurance brokerage).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 September 2018 the Bank owned 100% of the share capital of all subsidiaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\\r\\n\\r\\nBasis of preparation\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (the Bank or the Group) was prepared in accordance with IAS 34 \\r\\nInterim Financial reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed interim financial information does not contain all \\r\\nthe information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s \\r\\nannual financial statements as at 31 December 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed interim financial information are consistent with those \\r\\nfollowed in the preparation of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, except the new \\r\\naccounting standards which came into force from 1 January 2018 and are described below.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges in accounting policies\\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments\\r\\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 9 as issued by the IASB in July 2014 with a date of adoption of 1 January 2018, which resulted in \\r\\nchanges in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. The Group did \\r\\nnot early-adopt IFRS 9 in previous periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group elected not to restate comparative figures. Any adjustment to the \\r\\ncarrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings of \\r\\nthe current period.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in the changes in accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of \\r\\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. \\r\\n\\r\\nClassification and measurement\\r\\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component (determined \\r\\nin accordance with IFRS 15) at their transaction price. Other financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at initial \\r\\nrecognition at their fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n17\\r\\n\\r\\nloss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent measurement of the financial assets depends on the classification performed by the Group at initial recognition. At \\r\\ninitial recognition, financial assets can be classified into one of the following categories:\\r\\n\\r\\n • Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss,\\r\\n • Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI),\\r\\n • Financial assets measured at amortised cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nClassification is performed based on both the Group’s business model for managing financial assets and the characteristics of \\r\\ncontractual cash flows of the financial assets. However, financial assets that meet the amortised cost or fair value through other \\r\\ncomprehensive income measurement criteria, may be designated on initial recognition by the Group to fair value through profit \\r\\nor loss measurement option, provided that particular qualifying criteria are met. Additionally, the Group may make an irrevocable \\r\\nelection at initial recognition for particular investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value \\r\\nthrough profit or loss to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified into one of the following categories:\\r\\n • Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost,\\r\\n • Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nA financial liability is classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss if:\\r\\n • It meets the definition of “held for trading” and\\r\\n • It is designated upon initial recognition to fair value through the profit or loss measurement option.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll other financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment of financial assets\\r\\nIFRS 9 fundamentally changed the credit loss recognition methodology. The standard replaced IAS 39’s incurred loss approach \\r\\nwith a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. The Bank is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses \\r\\nfor all loans and other debt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. \\r\\nThe allowance is based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default in the next twelve months unless \\r\\nthere has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the probability of \\r\\ndefault over the life of the asset. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for purchased or \\r\\noriginated credit-impaired assets (POCI) regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument. The Bank \\r\\nhas established a policy to perform an assessment at the end of each reporting period of whether credit risk has increased \\r\\nsignificantly since initial recognition by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the \\r\\nfinancial instrument. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe assets to test for impairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes \\r\\nassets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk or which are classified as low risk (rating categorised as \\r\\n“Investment grade” or higher), stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 \\r\\nincludes defaulted assets. Significant assets in stage 3 are tested for impairment on an individual basis, while for insignificant \\r\\nassets a collective assessment is performed. In stage 1, the allowances equal the 12-month expected credit loss. In stage 2 and 3, \\r\\nthe allowances equal the lifetime expected credit losses. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne important driver for size of allowances under IFRS 9 is the trigger for transferring an asset from Stage 1 to Stage 2. The Bank \\r\\nhas decided to use a mix of absolute and relative changes (0.6 p.p. and 2.5 times) in 12-month point-in-time Probability of Default \\r\\n(PD) to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. In addition, customers with forbearance measures, \\r\\nincluded on the watch list and contracts with payments more than thirty days past due are also transferred to Stage 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agreed IFRS 9 impairment methodology is documented in internal procedures and applied in daily life. Integration into front \\r\\noffice business processes follows and is intended to be finalized during the year 2018, but this does not impact impairment \\r\\ncalculation. In general, IFRS 9 impairment model results in earlier recognition of credit losses for the respective items and \\r\\nincreases the amount of loss allowances recognised for these items. Moreover, the impairment calculations under IFRS 9 are more \\r\\nvolatile and pro-cyclical than under IAS 39, mainly due to the significant subjectivity applied in the forward-looking scenarios. IFRS \\r\\n9 impairment requirements are applied retrospectively, with transition impact recognized in retained earnings at 1 January 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n18\\r\\n\\r\\nImpact of the adoption of IFRS 9\\r\\nSet out below are disclosures relating to the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the Group.\\r\\n\\r\\nClassification and measurement of financial instruments\\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement category and the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 and IFRS 9 as at \\r\\nJanuary 2018 are compared as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nFinancial assets\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal measurement \\r\\ncategory under \\r\\n\\r\\nIAS 39\\r\\n\\r\\nNew measurement \\r\\ncategory under \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\nIAS 39 \\r\\ncarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nNew carrying \\r\\namount under IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\n1 January 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central \\r\\nbanks\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables Amortised cost 199 250 199 250\\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions Loans and receivables Amortised cost 148 893 148 888\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\nthrough profit or loss\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at \\r\\nFVTPL \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at \\r\\nFVTPL \\r\\n\\r\\n4 526 4 526\\r\\n\\r\\nDerivatives\\r\\nFair value through \\r\\n\\r\\nprofit or loss\\r\\nFair value through \\r\\n\\r\\nprofit or loss\\r\\n4 161 4 161\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables Loans and receivables Amortised cost 3 221 001 3 207 207\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no changes for classification and measurement of financial liabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nReconciliation of impairment allowance balance from IAS 39 to IFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table reconciles the prior period’s closing impairment allowance measured in accordance with the IAS 39 incurred \\r\\nloss model to the new impairment allowance measured in accordance with the IFRS 9 expected loss model as at 1 January 2018:\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nFinancial assets\\r\\n\\r\\nLoss allowance under IAS 39/\\r\\nProvision under IAS 37 Reclassifications Remeasurements\\r\\n\\r\\nCredit loss allowance \\r\\nunder IFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\nAmortised cost\\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks - - - -\\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 0 - -5 -5\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables -43 699 - -13 794 -57 493\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal -43 699 - -13 799 -57 498\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nFinancial liabilities Provision under IAS 37 Reclassifications Remeasurements\\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 carrying amount \\r\\n1 January 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nProvisions 650 - 372 1 022\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 650 - 372 1 022\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n19\\r\\n\\r\\nReconciliation of statement of financial position balances from IAS 39 to IFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table reconciles the carrying amounts of financial assets, from their previous measurement category in accordance \\r\\nwith IAS 39 to their new measurement categories upon transition to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018:\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nFinancial assets\\r\\n\\r\\nIAS 39 carrying amount \\r\\n31 December 2017 Reclassifications Remeasurements \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 carrying amount \\r\\n1 January 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nAmortised cost     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks    \\r\\n\\r\\nClosing balance under IAS 39 and \\r\\nopening balance under IFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\n199 250 - - 199 250\\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing balance under IAS 39 148 893 - - -\\r\\n\\r\\nRemeasurement (ECL allowances) - - -5 -\\r\\n\\r\\nOpening balance under IFRS 9 - - - 148 888\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing balance under IAS 39 3 221 001 - - -\\r\\n\\r\\nRemeasurement (ECL allowances) - - -13 794 -\\r\\n\\r\\nOpening balance under IFRS 9 - - - 3 207 207\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets measured at \\r\\namortised cost - total\\r\\n\\r\\n3 569 144 - -13 799 3 555 345\\r\\n\\r\\nFair value through profit or loss\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\nprofit or loss\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing balance under IAS 39 and \\r\\nopening balance under IFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\n4 526 - - 4 526\\r\\n\\r\\nDerivatives\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing balance under IAS 39 and \\r\\nopening balance under IFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\n4 161 - - 4 161\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\nprofit or loss - total\\r\\n\\r\\n8 687 - - 8 687\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nFinancial liabilities\\r\\n\\r\\nIAS 39 carrying amount \\r\\n31 December 2017 Reclassifications\\r\\n\\r\\nRemeasurements \\r\\n31 December 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 carrying amount \\r\\n1 January 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nProvisions - - - -\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing balance under IAS 39 \\r\\nand opening balance under \\r\\nIFRS 9\\r\\n\\r\\n650 - 372 1 022\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities - total 650 - 372 1 022\\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\\r\\nThe standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model that will \\r\\napply to revenue earned from a contract with a customer (with limited exceptions), regardless of the type of revenue transaction \\r\\nor the industry. The standard’s requirements also apply to the recognition and measurement of gains and losses on the sale of \\r\\nsome non-financial assets that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities (e.g., sales of property, plant and equipment \\r\\nor intangibles). Extensive disclosures will be required, including disaggregation of total revenue; information about performance \\r\\nobligations; changes in contract asset and liability account balances between periods and key judgments and estimates. \\r\\nManagement has assessed that the application of the standard did not have any effect on the Group financial statements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe core principle of IFRS 15 is that revenue must be recognised to reflect the transfer of services to customers at an amount that \\r\\nreflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for such services. This core principle is applied through a \\r\\nfive-step model:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Identify the contract with the customer, \\r\\n2) Identify the performance obligation in the contract,\\r\\n3) Determine the transaction price,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n20\\r\\n\\r\\n4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract,\\r\\n5) Recognise revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor each performance obligation identified, the Group determines at contract inception whether it satisfies the performance \\r\\nobligation over time or at a point in time, and whether the consideration is fixed or variable, including whether consideration is \\r\\nconstrained due to external factors. Consideration is subsequently allocated to the identified performance obligation. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor services provided over time, consideration is recognised when the service is provided to the customer assuming that a \\r\\nsignificant reversal of consideration will not occur. Examples of income earned for services satisfied over time include the fee \\r\\nincome earned for the asset management services. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf a performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time, then the income is recognised when the service is transferred to the \\r\\ncustomer. Examples of such income include fee income for executing transactions (clearing and settlement, customers’ securities \\r\\ntrading, payment cards transaction fees).\\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Clarifications)\\r\\nThe Clarifications apply for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. The objective \\r\\nof the Clarifications is to clarify the IASB’s intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts \\r\\nwith Customers, particularly the accounting of identifying performance obligations amending the wording of the “separately \\r\\nidentifiable” principle, of principal versus agent considerations including the assessment of whether an entity is a principal or \\r\\nan agent as well as applications of control principles and of licensing providing additional guidance for accounting of intellectual \\r\\nproperty and royalties. The Clarifications also provide additional practical expedients for entities that either apply IFRS 15 fully \\r\\nretrospectively or that elect to apply the modified retrospective approach. As described above, management has assessed that \\r\\nthe application of the standard did not have any material effect on the Group financial statements.\\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 Leases\\r\\nIFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases as of January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation \\r\\nand disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet model similar to the \\r\\naccounting for finance leases under IAS 17. The standard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees – leases of ’low-value’ \\r\\nassets (e.g., personal computers) and short-term leases (i.e., leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments (i.e., the lease liability) and an asset \\r\\nrepresenting the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e., the right-of-use asset). Lessees will be required to \\r\\nseparately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset. Lessees \\r\\nwill be also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events (e.g., a change in the lease term, a \\r\\nchange in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments). The lessee will \\r\\ngenerally recognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently the Group is analyzing the operating lease agreements to determine to what extent these will result in the recognition \\r\\nof assets and liabilities. Some of the commitments will be covered by the exception for short term and low value and some \\r\\ncommitments will not qualify as leases under IFRS16. The assessment of the potential effect of IFRS 16 on the financial statements \\r\\nof 2019 is in process. \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 3. RISK MANAGEMENT\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required \\r\\nin the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with the Group’s annual financial statements as at 31 \\r\\nDecember 2017. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been no major changes in the risk management or in any risk management policies since year’s end.\\r\\n\\r\\nKey judgments, inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used for assessing expected credit losses.\\r\\nWith the adoption of IFRS 9, a three-stage model was introduced:\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 1 – part of the portfolio for which no significant deterioration in credit quality has occurred since initial recognition (or the \\r\\nexposure is of low credit risk) and the financial instrument is not considered credit-impaired;\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 2 – part of the portfolio for which significant deterioration in credit quality has occurred since initial recognition, evidenced \\r\\nby the SICR – significant increase in credit risk – indicator, and the financial instrument is not considered credit-impaired;\\r\\n\\r\\nStage 3 – credit-impaired part of the portfolio. Luminor equates default and credit-impairment definitions so that all defaulted \\r\\nexposures are treated as credit-impaired and all credit-impaired exposures are treated as defaulted. This approach is based \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n21\\r\\n\\r\\non the fact that the default definition used by the Bank covers all events indicated by IFRS 9 as possible evidence that financial \\r\\ninstrument is credit-impaired and all of these events are considered by Luminor as having a detrimental impact on the estimated \\r\\nfuture cash flows from the instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional category is POCI financial assets - financial assets that were purchased or originated as credit-impaired. POCI assets \\r\\nare subject to unchanging classification, i.e. financial asset once classified as POCI remains in this group until derecognized. The \\r\\nPOCI classification is determined at the financial instrument level.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor applies low credit risk exemption to the following classes of exposures:\\r\\n • central governments,\\r\\n • central bank,\\r\\n • regional governments,\\r\\n • local authorities,\\r\\n • institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe counterparty must fulfil the condition of having a credit rating indicating investment grade.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, the financial asset is treated as facing significant increase in credit risk if at least one of the following SICR indicators is \\r\\nidentified after initial recognition of the financial instrument and was not present as of its origination:\\r\\n\\r\\n • Significant increase of 12-month PD – significant increase of point-in-time (PIT) forward-looking 12-month PD since initial \\r\\nrecognition until reporting date (2.5 times and 0.6 p.p. jointly),\\r\\n\\r\\n • Risk grade 9 or 10 – risk grade 9 or 10 as of reporting date,\\r\\n • 30 days past due – more than 30 days past due as of reporting date,\\r\\n • Forborne performing – forborne performing status as of reporting date (forbearance not triggering non-performing status) \\r\\n\\r\\nin accordance with FINREP instruction reporting requirements,\\r\\n • Watch list – watch list status as of reporting date.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the SICR indicators are recognized at financial instrument level in order to track changes in credit risk since initial recognition \\r\\ndate for a particular financial instrument, even though some of them refer to the customer’s characteristics.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor identifies default when either or both of the following default indicators have taken place: \\r\\n1. The customer is more than 90 days past due on any material obligation to the Bank;\\r\\n2. The customer is considered unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor exposure to banks, the default is recognized when payments are due more than 7 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of identifying unlikelihood of payment,  the elements taken as indications of unlikelihood of payment include the \\r\\nfollowing:\\r\\n\\r\\n • Distressed restructuring of credit obligation (forbearance triggering non-performing status in accordance with FINREP \\r\\ninstruction requirements); \\r\\n\\r\\n • Major financial problems of the customer (present or expected), i.e. significant financial difficulties;\\r\\n • Recognition of specific credit risk adjustment resulting from a significant decline in credit quality of the exposure;\\r\\n • Bankruptcy of the customer or similar protection;\\r\\n • Disappearance of an active market for a financial asset because of the financial difficulties of the customer;\\r\\n • Sell of credit obligation at material credit-related economic loss;\\r\\n • Purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses;\\r\\n • Credit fraud;\\r\\n • External rating indicating default.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe default is recognised at the customer level.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturn to a non-defaulted status is possible not earlier than after 3 months when all default triggers cease to be met. During these \\r\\n3 months of the probation period, the timely payments by the customer should be ensured. The exemption from the general rule \\r\\nof probation is distressed restructuring where at least 1 year needs to pass since the moment that restructuring measures were \\r\\nextended and the moment when a customer is deemed to have an ability to comply with the post-restructuring conditions. This \\r\\napproach is consistent with FINREP instruction requirements for treatment of forborne non-performing exposures.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the shift from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 approach, the incurred loss model was replaced by the expected credit loss (ECL) model. For \\r\\nStage 1 financial assets, loss allowances equal the 12-month ECL while for Stage 2 and Stage 3 financial instruments, lifetime ECL \\r\\nis calculated. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Purchased or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) financial assets, ECL is estimated in the lifetime horizon until the maturity. \\r\\nThe loss expected at initial recognition is referred to as Initial impairment. In subsequent periods, only the cumulative changes in \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n22\\r\\n\\r\\nthe lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition are recognised in profit or loss. Collective assessment of impairment \\r\\nis performed for all financial instruments that are not defaulted as of the reporting date, i.e. are classified as either Stage 1 or \\r\\nStage 2 or are non-defaulted POCI asset. The expected loss is calculated as the probability-weighted average of losses expected \\r\\nin different macroeconomic scenarios. Expected loss in concrete macroeconomic scenario is calculated as the multiple of \\r\\nprobability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and cumulative prepayment rate and is discounted \\r\\nusing the effective interest rate. PD curves, LGD curves and EAD curves are estimated for all months until the maturity date of \\r\\nthe facility. If the facility is classified as Stage 1, expected losses are estimated over the period of up to 12 months. If the facility is \\r\\nclassified as Stage 2, then the expected loss is estimated over the period up to maturity date of the facility.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstimation of PD and LGD curves take into account forward-looking macroeconomic information. The methodology of estimation \\r\\nof these risk parameters includes modelling of the relationship between risk parameters and macroeconomic variables. Forecasts \\r\\nof macroeconomic variables under different scenarios for 3 upcoming years together with scenario probabilities are prepared \\r\\nby Luminor macroeconomists. Three macroeconomic scenarios are considered: the baseline/realistic, positive, and pessimistic \\r\\nscenarios (with the probability weights of 60%, 25% and 15% respectively). Macroeconomic scenarios that are prepared for the \\r\\nestimation of expected losses are consistent with scenarios which are used in credit risk stress testing process. Macroeconomic \\r\\nvariables that are included in the modelling are annual change in real GDP, unemployment rate and annual change of residential \\r\\nreal estate price. Starting from the fourth year. it is assumed that risk parameters (PD and LGD) converge to their long-term \\r\\naverage levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stage 3 exposures (or defaulted POCI assets), which are classified as material, Luminor evaluates the impairment amount \\r\\non individual basis (individual assessment) under discounted cash flows (DCF) method. Two scenarios – base case and risk case \\r\\n– are used. For exceptional cases, usage of one scenario can be sufficient. The circumstances when only one scenario might be \\r\\nacceptable could be the deep workout case or the case when total exposure of defaulted borrower falls below the materiality \\r\\nthreshold.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stage 3 exposures (or defaulted POCI assets), which are classified as immaterial, Luminor evaluates the impairment amount \\r\\non collective basis (collective assessment). Impairment is calculated applying the pool rate for the unsecured part. Different pool \\r\\nrates are applied for these pools distinguished by Luminor:\\r\\n\\r\\n • mortgage loans and private credits to private individuals,\\r\\n • consumer loans and other loans to private individuals (including leasing),\\r\\n • SMEs (all financial instruments to legal entities).\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 4. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\\r\\nThe new expected loss approach model had a negative impact on the Bank’s regulatory capital. By  decision of the Board of \\r\\nDirectors of Luminor Group AB, the Bank did not apply transitional arrangements allowed by EU Regulation 2017/2395  and \\r\\nrecognised the full effect of the implementation of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. The capital adequacy ratio is still significantly above \\r\\nthe regulatory minimum and in line with the internal Risk Appetite statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR 30 September 2018 31 December 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nOWN FUNDS\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where the \\r\\nfair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active \\r\\nmarkets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs \\r\\nto these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but where observable market data is not available, \\r\\njudgment is required to establish fair values. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of loans to customers, customer deposits, amounts due from credit institutions and amounts due to credit \\r\\ninstitutions and other financial assets and liabilities, obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows \\r\\nusing rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn assessing the fair value for financial assets, the management has performed discounted cash flow analysis; up-to-date market \\r\\ninformation at the moment of assessment is used for assessing cash flows. For loans, where base interest rates are pegged to \\r\\nfloating market interest rates, the Group has considered the difference between the average interest margin of issued loans \\r\\nand average interest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has not been changed \\r\\n(increased) since issuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal to fair value.\\r\\n\\r\\nFair value of financial liabilities at amortized cost such as Loans and deposits from credit institutions and Deposits from customers \\r\\nwhich are not on demand have been estimated based on discounted cash flow model using interest rates for similar products as \\r\\nat period’s end. Fair value of those financial liabilities that are on demand or have floating interest rate have been estimated to be \\r\\napproximately equal to its carrying amount.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table below summarizes the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair \\r\\nvalue. Financial instruments are distributed by 3 levels of fair value:\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value     measurement is directly \\r\\nor indirectly observable.\\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of all Bank contracted derivatives  is defined as level 2. These are interest rate swaps and in all cases pricing is based \\r\\non market observable inputs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no movements of financial instruments between the levels during 2018 and 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nValuation of all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value was performed as at 30 September 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n27\\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\r\\nFair value measurement using\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nDate of \\r\\n\\r\\nvaluation\\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1)\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 2)\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) Total\\r\\n\\r\\nAssets 30.09.2018\\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash balances with central \\r\\nbanks\\r\\n\\r\\n5 369 559 416 0 564 786\\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 0 74 524 0 74 524\\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 3 218 0 3 218\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\nprofit or loss\\r\\n\\r\\n0 4 623 0 4 623\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 0 0 3 294 164 3 294 164\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  5 369 641 782 3 294 164 3 941 315\\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities 30.09.2018\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions\\r\\n\\r\\n0 1 611 954 0 1 611 954\\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 1 776 620 0 1 776 620\\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 0 65 167 65 167\\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 3 218 0 3 218\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  0 3 391 792 65 167 3 456 960\\r\\n\\r\\n Fair value measurement using\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nDate of \\r\\n\\r\\nvaluation\\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1)\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs  (Level 2)\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs        \\r\\n(Level 3) Total\\r\\n\\r\\nAssets 31 December 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash balances with central \\r\\nbanks\\r\\n\\r\\n0 0 199 250 199 250\\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions \\r\\n(demand) \\r\\n\\r\\n0 0 92 832 92 832\\r\\n\\r\\nReceivables from parent pledged as \\r\\ncollateral\\r\\n\\r\\n0 0 37 647 37 647\\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 4 161 0 4 161\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\nprofit or loss\\r\\n\\r\\n0 4 526 0 4 526\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 0 0 3 239 414 3 239 414\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  0 8 687 3 569 143 3 577 830\\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities 31 December 2017\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions\\r\\n\\r\\n0 0 1 397 509 1 397 509\\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 0 1 648 598 1 648 598\\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 0 65 007 65 007\\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 4 161 0 4 161\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 0 0 3 111 114 3 115 275\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n28\\r\\n\\r\\nDemand deposits due from credit institutions and loans and receivables to customers are issued on market conditions.

The rates for the financial instruments are mostly floating. In determining the fair value of loans and receivables \\r\\nto customers, management judgements are used. Loans and receivables from customers are thus categorised under hierarchy \\r\\nlevel 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement for liabilities is based on the calculation using non-observable inputs thus the same categorization as for \\r\\nassets should be applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 16.

SEGMENT REPORTING\\r\\n\\r\\nMeasurement of performance of operating segments\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM), as required by IFRS 8. At Luminor, the CODM has been defined as Group Executive Management. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Executive Management Committee monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making \\r\\ndecisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profits \\r\\nor losses and is measured consistently with operating profits or losses in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income \\r\\nis reported net as management primarily relies on net interest revenue as a performance measure, along with the gross income \\r\\nand expense.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 October 2017, Luminor Group implemented new reportable operating segments, and therefore there is no comparable \\r\\ndata with respective segmentation for previous periods. \\r\\n\\r\\nBasis of segmentation\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the four main business areas: Corporate Banking, Business Clients, Household and Private \\r\\nBanking. Other operating segments below the quantitative thresholds in IFRS 8 and that are not completely allocated are included \\r\\nin the Other segment.\\r\\n\\r\\nReportable Operating Segments\\r\\nCorporate Banking service large corporate customers and Business  service small and medium-sized corporate customers. \\r\\nCorporate & Business Banking works with a relationship-driven customer service model with a customer-centric value proposition \\r\\nfor Luminor’s corporate customers. The Household segment serves Luminor’s household customers in the Baltic markets, through \\r\\nvarious channels offering a full range of financial services and solutions. The business area includes advisory and service staff, \\r\\nchannels, product units, back office and IT under a common strategy, operating model and governance across markets. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n30\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking provides high-quality investment, savings and risk management products. It also manages customers’ assets and \\r\\ngives financial advice to affluent and high net worth individuals as well as to institutional investors. The Other segment includes \\r\\nresults not fully allocated to any of the operating segments.\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\n01 January 2018 to 30 September 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate \\r\\nBanking\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness \\r\\nclients Household\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate \\r\\nBanking Other Total\\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 13 448 6 355 11 045 912 21 446 53 206\\r\\n\\r\\nNet fees & commission income 3 071 1 136 3 364 252 3 921 11 744\\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income 1 034 291 391 80 1 045 2 841\\r\\n\\r\\nOther income 92 144 17 0 2 210 2 463\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal income 17 645 7 926 14 817 1 244 28 623 70 255\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel costs, administrative costs \\r\\nand depreciation \\r\\n\\r\\n-7 395 -4 269 -13 773 -781 -19 437 -45 655\\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (losses/ reversal) 4 963 -4 303 3 811 13 -2 935 1 549\\r\\n\\r\\nOther 0 0 0 0 -1 674 -1 674\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating profit 15 213 -646 4 855 476 4 577 24 475\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\nQ3 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate \\r\\nBanking\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness \\r\\nclients Household\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate \\r\\nBanking Other Total\\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 6 798 3 262 5 733 427 1 421 17 641\\r\\n\\r\\nNet fees & commission income 1 543 655 1 797 121 -35 4 081\\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income 787 110 152 98 -58 1 089\\r\\n\\r\\nOther income 72 0 13 0 -402 -317\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal income 9 200 4 027 7 695 646 925 22 493\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel costs, administrative costs \\r\\nand depreciation \\r\\n\\r\\n-3 328 -1 715 -6 087 -398 -1 219 -12 747\\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (losses/ reversal) -2 380 383 -781 -44 7 -2 815\\r\\n\\r\\nOther 0 0 0 0 149 149\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating profit 3 492 2 695 827 204 -137 7 081\\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR\\r\\n30 September 2018\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate \\r\\nBanking\\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness \\r\\nclients Household\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate \\r\\nBanking Other Total\\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 1 391 087 503 885 1 394 673 37 195 0 3 326 840\\r\\n\\r\\nOther assets 637 491 637 491\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal assets 1 391 087 503 885 1 394 673 37 195 637 491 3 964 331\\r\\n \\r\\nDeposits from customers 813 229 286 297 369 456 230 634 0 1 699 616\\r\\n\\r\\nOther liabilities 1 792 177 1 792 177\\r\\n\\r\\nTotal liabilities 813 229 286 297 369 456 230 634 1 792 177 3 491 793\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 18. TAX\\r\\nStarting from 1 April 2018, the quarterly profits of credit institutions are subject to corporate income tax at the rate of 14%. The \\r\\ntax is payable by the 10th day of the third month of the following quarter. Once the profits are distributed, an additional income \\r\\ntax of up to 6% is further payable, which adds up to the total tax rate of up to 20%. The rate of the additional tax depends on the \\r\\nregularity of the dividend payments. If no dividends are paid, the advance tax payments are not refunded.  Advance income tax \\r\\nwas first time applied to the bank’s profit for 2018 Q2 in the amount of 1 144 thousand euros.

Total shareholder equity of Luminor amounts to 1.8 billion euros \\r\\nand is capitalized at CET1 18%. Luminor’s vision is to become the best financial ecosystem for its customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, an agreement was signed between DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank AB with US-based private equity \\r\\nfirm Blackstone to sell the majority stake in Luminor. As part of the transaction, Blackstone will acquire a 60% majority stake \\r\\nin the bank. Nordea and DNB will retain equal 20% equity stakes in Luminor and will continue to support the bank with long \\r\\nterm funding, expertise and ongoing representation on the Board of Directors. Additionally, Blackstone has entered into an \\r\\nagreement with Nordea to purchase their remaining 20% stake over the coming years. Closing of the transaction is subject \\r\\nto European Central Bank’s and local supervisory authorities’ approvals and is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis transaction represents the largest majority-stake acquisition of a universal bank by private equity in the last decade \\r\\nglobally, and one of the largest M&A transactions in Baltic history. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (or “Luminor Estonia”) offers a wide range of products and services to its customers in all channels, digital \\r\\nand physical, with 10 offices including headquarter in Tallinn and customer service centers in Tartu, Pärnu, Viljandi, Rakvere \\r\\nand Jõhvi, in addition a cashless advisory desk in Kuressaare. Luminor has a total of 100 ATMs throughout Estonia.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of Q4 2018, Luminor Estonia employed 671 full-time employees and served ca 138,000 clients in the private and \\r\\nbusiness segments, with a market share of 16% in lending and 10% in deposits, making it the third largest financial service \\r\\nprovider on the market. Luminor Estonia’s capital ratio at the end of Q4 2018 was 18.80%. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Estonia has five subsidiaries: Luminor Liising AS, which provides leasing for vehicles, heavy equipment and other \\r\\nassets; Luminor Pensions Estonia AS, which focuses on growing the pension assets of clients; Luminor Kindlustusmaakler \\r\\nOÜ, which provides insurance broker services; and Promano OÜ and Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ, which provide asset management \\r\\nservices. \\r\\n\\r\\nMoody’s has assigned long- and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, as well as a local \\r\\ncurrency long-term (P)Baa2 senior MTN rating to Luminor Bank AS. \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview \\r\\nDespite all the macro headwinds and challenges emanating from the external sector including trade tensions and slowing \\r\\nglobal trade, 2018 was still overall a rather good growth year for Estonia. Estonia's open economy is highly integrated with \\r\\nthe economies of the Euro area and the Nordic countries and has developed hand in hand with them, supported by strong \\r\\nlabour markets. As expected, economic momentum did only marginally moderate last year from a robust 4.9% y/y pace in \\r\\n2017 to 3.8% y/y (Q1-Q3 18). As a key positive development, export revenues picked up speed as from Q2 following a weak \\r\\nstart of the year, and remained on the modest growth trend at year-end. However, the key drag to GDP growth resulted \\r\\nfrom investments with growth affected last but not least by last year’s strong base (one-off large investment transactions) \\r\\nand elevated uncertainty in the external environment.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n4 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of industry branches, the contributions to decent Q3 growth (4.2% y/y) were the strongest by construction and \\r\\nexport-orientated manufacturing sector, followed by science and technology plus the pivotal ICT branches. Expectedly, \\r\\nconsumers appetite remained rather elevated on the back of strong labour markets with somewhat softer demand for large \\r\\nticket items at year end (confirming moderation in the housing market activity). The consumers have not really opted for \\r\\nopening the purses to spend the extra boost received from the past taxation reform (which effectively increased the non-\\r\\ntaxable income). As a positive development inflation has expectedly trended lower with waning pressure from energy prices, \\r\\nwhich is expected further to exert downward price pressure in H1 2019. Overall, Estonia’s underlying growth is expected to \\r\\ncontinue broad-based with risks in the external sector pointing towards gradual moderation of current strong growth trend. \\r\\nIn comparison with the euro-area average the deceleration of growth in Estonia has remained limited with cyclical indicators \\r\\nin domestic and external sectors (including economic and consumer confidence) pointing to only soft moderation ahead.  \\r\\n\\r\\nActivities \\r\\nIn Q4 2018, Luminor continued with the finalization of the legal aspects of its merger, which will see the full integration of \\r\\nthe banks, continuing operations in all three Baltic states through the Estonian bank and its registered branches in Latvia \\r\\nand Lithuania. In May 2018, Luminor received confirmation from the European Central Bank that the branches in Latvia and \\r\\nLithuania could be established and commence operations. Starting from 2 January 2019 Luminor continues its operations \\r\\nas one integrated pan-Baltic bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nHOUSEHOLD SEGMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of Q4 2018, Luminor Estonia had approximately 116,000 household clients. In Q4 2018 Luminor Estonia focused \\r\\non increasing volumes of saving and investment products through educating and advising our customers. Dedicated team \\r\\nof advisors were established and trained in order to give the best professional saving and investment advice to the \\r\\ncustomers.  As a result, in Q4 2018 household segment customers deposits in Luminor Estonia increased by 2.7%.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal lending average volume remained stable. In Q4 2018 new housing loan volumes were decreasing compared to Q3 2018, \\r\\nwhereas new housing loan average margin has increased. In December 2018 Luminor Estonia started with external Consumer \\r\\nlending campaign in order to help the customers to cover unforeseeable expenses or to pay for larger purchases. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s goal is to become the home bank for the target customers by offering professional advice and excellent customer \\r\\nservice. Delivering good customer experiences and meeting our customers’ needs are essential to Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nPRIVATE BANKING SEGMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking customer activities are centered on everyday banking and growing the savings portfolio. We help high net \\r\\nworth individuals and their families to grow, manage and preserve their wealth. By the end of Q4 2018, Luminor Estonia had \\r\\naround 1,000 Private Banking customers. In Q4 2018, Private Banking focused on strategic positioning and attracting new \\r\\nfunding through collaboration with Luminor’s other business segments and marketing to help deliver results.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBUSINESS AND CORPORATE CLIENT SEGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Q4 2018, Luminor Estonia continued to serve its ca 21,000 customers in the corporate and business client segments. \\r\\nLuminor Estonia continued profitable lending growth to small and medium-sized business clients. Our activities towards \\r\\nbusiness clients were supported by sales campaign that focused attracting new customers. In the year end Luminor Estonia \\r\\ntogether with Eesti Meedia AS and Regional Development Centers started an Entrepreneurial Courage Award to recognize \\r\\nstrong local and regional companies who have made a remarkable change in their business.  \\r\\n\\r\\nQ4 corporate client segment results were in line with macroeconomic developments. Lending to large corporations and \\r\\ninternational customers had a positive impact in lending profitability and deposit balance. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n5 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOur corporate customers value our tailored financial products and relationship banking concept. In Q4 2018 special focus \\r\\nwas given to diversify customer portfolios and deposit book and to double check our AML internal routines towards \\r\\ncorporate customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 December 2018 Private Banking and corporate client segment invited its customers to hear about insights on \\r\\nupcoming macroeconomic and foreign policy trends. \\r\\n\\r\\nLEASING \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing services for vehicles, heavy equipment and other assets for private individuals and business clients are provided \\r\\nthrough the subsidiary Luminor Liising AS. End of Q4 2018, the total leasing portfolio amounted to 937 million euros and new \\r\\nfinancing volume in last quarter was 68 million euros. About 50% of new financing was granted to passenger cars which is \\r\\nbiggest single asset group in leasing portfolio. \\r\\n\\r\\nPENSIONS \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Q4 2018 Luminor Estonia continued to provide 2nd and 3rd pillar and employer pension fund management services to its \\r\\ncustomers through its subsidiary Luminor Pensions Estonia AS.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Pensions increased its investments in activities that brought the information of pension funds and funds closer to \\r\\nthe client. Global capital markets fell in Q4 2018 and had a negative impact on pension fund short-term results. By the end \\r\\nof Q4 2018, assets under management had reached 317 million euros, a minor decrease compared to previous quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, Luminor's long-term performance of Estonian pension funds is among the best in the market in both \\r\\nsecond and third pillar funds. In Q4 2018 the customer portfolio had a healthy growth and reached to 51,000 customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN LUMINOR \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are creating a new-generation financial services provider because we are determined to build a better tomorrow – for \\r\\nfamilies and businesses and for the communities and countries in which we live and operate. We believe in contributing to \\r\\nthe development of the local communities in which we operate. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are committed to taking into account corporate governance, social conditions and environment in all of our activities, \\r\\nincluding product and service development, advisory services and sales, investment and credit decisions, and other \\r\\noperations.

Focusing \\r\\non serving the Baltic customers we continuously aim for a full transparency in customers background, availability of KYC \\r\\ndata and economic rational in activities. At Luminor, we have zero tolerance towards money laundering and other financial \\r\\ncrime risk. Luminor has developed and implemented a comprehensive set of measures to identify, manage and control its \\r\\nrisks. We comply with sanctions laws and follow the guidelines, recommendations and standards issued by local regulatory \\r\\nand supervisory authorities and relevant international organizations, as well as those issued by local banking associations \\r\\nand financial intelligence units in each Baltic state. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur Compliance and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) functions are operating at the pan-Baltic level, having competence \\r\\ncenters   and highly experienced professionals in the following areas: data protection, AML/ Certified Fraud Examiners (CFT), \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n6 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFATCA, IT compliance and digital channels, business integrity, bank products and new product development. Luminor’s \\r\\nAML, Compliance and Anti-Financial Crime units employs over 100 professionals, maintaining a robust compliance \\r\\nframework and processes through the organization. \\r\\n\\r\\nSIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER 31 DECEMBER 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries \\r\\nthrough the Estonian registered bank and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all assets, \\r\\nrights and liabilities of Luminor Latvia and Luminor Lithuania were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank will \\r\\ncontinue the same activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 2019 Luminor will be simplifying its operating model and reducing its staff numbers from the current ca 3000 \\r\\nemployees, at all levels (including management), comprising around 130 employees in Estonia, 250 employees in Latvia and \\r\\n420 employees in Lithuania. \\r\\n\\r\\nStarting from 2 January 2019, the deposits and financial instruments of the depositors and investment services clients of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Latvian branch and Luminor Bank AS Lithuanian branch will be guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and \\r\\ninvestor protection scheme established and operated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new simplified structure and governance model enables the bank faster decision making, provides excellent cross-\\r\\nborder collaboration opportunities and improves efficiency. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2 January 2019, after completion of the merger, Luminor has a new organizational set up, a new governance structure \\r\\nand new members of management bodies. Erkki Raasuke will continue as Luminor ’s CEO and Nils Melngailis will be chairing \\r\\nthe supervisory board.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new governance structure of Luminor: \\r\\n\\r\\nSupervisory Council of Luminor Bank AS \\r\\n\\r\\n• Nils Melngailis, Chairman of the Council \\r\\n• Bjørn Erik Naess, Member of the Council  \\r\\n• Jörgen Christian Andersen, Member of the Council \\r\\n• Michael Jackson, Member of the Council \\r\\n• Trygve Young, Member of the Council \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nOn 23 January 2019 two additional council members, were appointed to Luminor—Ari Kaperi and Nadine Faruque. \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement Board of Luminor Bank AS \\r\\n\\r\\n• Erkki Raasuke, Chairman of the Management Board \\r\\n• Christian Wallentin, Member of the Management Board, CFO, Head of Financial division \\r\\n• Kristina Siimar, Member of the Management Board, Head of Products and Offerings \\r\\n• Kerli Gabrilovica, Member of the Management Board, Head of Luminor Latvian branch \\r\\n• Andrius Načajus, Member of the Management Board, Head of Luminor Lithuanian branch \\r\\n• Hannu Saksala, Member of the Management Board, Head of Risk division \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nOn 31 January 2019 Christian Wallentin, CFO and Head of Financial division has resigned from his position and management \\r\\nboard, to pursue other interests. Following Wallentins resignation, Tina Kukka Head of Transformation Management Office, \\r\\nwill assume the role of interim CFO and lead the financial division along with her current duties. New CFO will be appointed \\r\\nsoon.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n7 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe permanent Supervisory Council committees which were previously established for each Baltic country separately are \\r\\ngoing forward and operating as single committees on a group level, comprising Audit Committee, Risk Committee, \\r\\nNomination Committee and Remuneration Committee.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter completing the cross-border merger, Luminor has taken steps to re-organize its operating model.  On 7 January 2019 \\r\\nLuminor has decided to proceed with the next phase of transformation, including changing operating model. The bank aims \\r\\nto transform its operating model by simplifying its structure and decision process, unifying and executing IT consolidation, \\r\\nstrengthening its controls, and becoming more efficient, more resilient and more resolvable.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is customer-driven organization and our operating model is built to support regional scale, business development \\r\\nand efficiency, but also high relevance in customer intimacy. With the adjusted operating model, Luminor expects to \\r\\nsignificantly reduce the operating expenses and create the capacity to invest for the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Results \\r\\nThe merger of the Baltic businesses of DNB and Nordea in October 2017 has had a significant impact both on the financial \\r\\nresult and operational focus. The consolidated financial information prior to the merger represents consolidated results of \\r\\nDNB’s respective entities, whereas starting from 1 October 2017, such financial information also reflects the effects of the \\r\\nacquisition of assets and liabilities of Nordea. As a result, comparability of consolidated financial information between \\r\\nJanuary-December 2017 and January-December 2018 is limited in light of the effects of the merger. \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit earned in Q4 2018 was 0.6 million euros, which was 6.5 million euros less than Q3 2018 mainly due to tax on \\r\\ndividends recorded in Q4 2018. Net interest margin was 1.7%. Net total operating income increased 3% in Q4 2018 compared \\r\\nto Q3 2018, while total operating expenses increased 51% in the same period, driven by higher IT development costs. \\r\\n\\r\\nKEY FIGURES* \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR Jan-Dec 2018 Q4 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit 25 095  620 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity 468 377 473 530 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE), % 5.4 1.3 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets 3 828 926 4 012 451 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA), % 0.7 0.1 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 69 957  16 752 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage Interest Earning Assets 3 794 325 3 976 956 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM), % 1.8 1.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio (C/I), % 69.4 82.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n* Quarterly ratios and Jan-Dec 2018 ratios (ROE, ROA, NIM, C/I) have been expressed on an annualized basis. \\r\\n \\r\\nExplanations  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity (belonging to owners of company) = (equity at end of reporting period + equity at end of previous period) / 2 \\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) = Net profit / Average equity * 100%  \\r\\nAverage assets = (assets at end of reporting period + assets at end of previous period) / 2  \\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) = Net profit / Assets, average * 100  \\r\\nAverage interest earning assets = (interest-earning assets at end of reporting period + interest-earning assets at end of previous period) / 2 \\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) = Net interest income / Interest earning assets, average * 100 \\r\\nCost / Income ratio = Total operating expenses / Total net income * 100 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n8 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers decreased 1% compared to 30 September 2018 to 3.2 billion euros at 31 December 2018. Loans to non-\\r\\nfinancial corporate customers comprised 51% and loans to households 45% of the credit portfolio of Luminor. The market \\r\\nshare of Luminor’s loans in Estonia was approximately 16%. \\r\\n\\r\\nLending Deposits \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers (excluding deposits from credit institutions) totalled 1.7 billion euros at 31 December 2018, \\r\\ndecreasing 3% from 30 September 2018. Deposits from non-financial corporate clients comprised 49% and deposits from \\r\\nhouseholds 29% of the customer deposit portfolio of Luminor. The market share of Luminor’s deposits in Estonia was \\r\\napproximately 10%. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe loan-to-deposit ratio increased in Q4 2018 to 189% from 185% in Q3.  \\r\\n\\r\\nASSET QUALITY FOR Q4 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe credit quality of the Luminor Estonia lending portfolio as at the end of Q4 2018 has slightly improved. At the end of \\r\\nDecember 2018 allowances for on-balance expected credit losses were calculated as 34 million euros, i.e. approximately \\r\\n1.1% of the Luminor Estonia’s loan portfolio. Decrease in the amount and share of allowances is related mostly to the \\r\\ndecreased loan portfolio volume, however, in some particular client segments increase in the allowances has taken place. \\r\\nThe share of impaired loans in total loan portfolio has slightly decreased and amounts to 3.4%, what is mostly caused by \\r\\nimprovement of the large customers performance. \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR Household Non-financial \\r\\ncorporations \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial \\r\\ncorporations \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral \\r\\ngovernments \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal* \\r\\n\\r\\nGross Loans 1 447 887 1 673 532 39 868 85 854 3 248 141 \\r\\n\\r\\nAllowances -7 095 -27 133 -117 -9 -34 354 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet Loans 1 440 792 1 646 399 39 751 85 845 3 212 787 \\r\\n\\r\\nGross Impaired Loans 21 183 89 223 0 0 110 406 \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment ratio % 0.49% 1.62% 0.29% 0.01% 1.06% \\r\\n\\r\\nGross impaired Loans vs Gross Loans  \\r\\n(NPL ratio) % 1.46%\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n5.33%\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n0.00%\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n0.00%\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n3.40%\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAllowances vs Gross impaired Loans % 33.49% 30.41% N/A N/A 31.12% \\r\\n\\r\\n* excluding Loans to Credit Institutions \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n9 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nExplanations: \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment ratio % = Allowances / Gross Loans \\r\\nGross impaired loans vs Gross Loans (NPL ratio) % = Gross impaired Loans / Gross Loans  \\r\\nAllowances vs Impaired Loans = Allowances(Provisions)/ Gross Impaired Loans \\r\\n\\r\\nFUNDING \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Estonia has a strong and prudent liquidity risk profile. The funding base consists of a large deposit base, issued \\r\\ndebt securities and funding from parent banks, among other items. The funding base is mainly euro-denominated. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor Estonia a Senior Unsecured Medium-Term Note Program rating of Baa2. The \\r\\nassignment of rating was followed by a 350 million senior unsecured inaugural public bond issue with a maturity of 3 years \\r\\nand coupon of 1.50%. The bond is listed on the Euronext Dublin Stock Exchange. Despite the market turbulence at the time \\r\\nof issuance, Luminor was able to attract investors around Europe supported by strong local demand. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of Q4 2014, Luminor Estonia had utilised 1.25 billion euros in funding from the parent banks. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nUtilized parent funding amounts to 3.71 billion euros at the Luminor group level and is provided by the two parent banks in the \\r\\nform of a syndicate, where each parent bank provides 50%. Long-term funding was committed for 6 years (4+2), beginning \\r\\nfrom the 1 October 2017 when Luminor was established and short-term funding in the form of revolving credit of 364 days. \\r\\nIn addition to the current outstanding utilized funding, there is also a committed credit line of 0.9 billion euros in place (not \\r\\nutilized at present). When Luminor attracts wholesale long-term (longer than one year) funding externally, the intent is to \\r\\namortize an equal amount of parent funding. \\r\\n\\r\\nRating \\r\\n\\r\\nMoody’s Investors Service has assigned to Luminor Bank AS (Luminor Estonia) foreign and local currency long- and short-\\r\\nterm deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, as well as a long-term Baa2 senior MTN credit rating. On 11 October 2018, Moody’s \\r\\nconfirmed the local currency long-term senior unsecured debt rating of Baa2 to Luminor Bank AS (Estonia) prior to the EMTN \\r\\nissuance. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2 January 2019 Luminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) are branches of Luminor Bank AS (Estonia). \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n10 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY \\r\\n\\r\\nThe LCR (liquidity coverage ratio) for Luminor Estonia was 238.0% at the end of Q4 2018, according to the Delegated Act’s \\r\\nLCR definition. The liquidity buffer is composed of highly liquid central bank eligible securities and cash. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of Q4 2018, Luminor Estonia’s NSFR (net stable funding ratio) was 112.0% using an RSF (required stable funding) \\r\\nfactor of 85% for qualifying collateralised mortgages. \\r\\n\\r\\nRatio 31 Dec 2018 30 Sep 2018 30 Jun 2018 30 Mar 2018 31 Dec 2017 \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 238.0% 162.9% 160.7% 133.3% 112.0% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR** 112.0% 111.3% 108.4% 100.5% 102.0% \\r\\n\\r\\n**mortgages that would qualify for 35% or lower risk weight are calculated with 85% RSF factor. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nDeposits from customers are mainly from residents of Estonia. In total, 99.0% of all deposits from household and non-\\r\\nfinancial corporates are from EU residents. \\r\\n\\r\\nCAPITAL \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Estonia’s capital adequacy ratio reached 18.80% by 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: 17.69%), which is well \\r\\nabove the internal target of 17.0% and the applicable regulatory requirements. Capital adequacy increased as a result of the \\r\\ndecrease of total risk exposure amount for the period ended on 31 December 2018. The capital adequacy of Luminor Estonia \\r\\nis fully covered by CET1 capital. \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital ratios \\r\\n\\r\\nPosition  Q4 2018 Q3 2018 Q2 2018 Q1 2018 Q4 2017 \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital adequacy

\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL \\r\\nSTATEMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS is a local credit institution whose sole owner is Luminor Group AB and ultimate owners, parents are Nordea \\r\\nBank AB, DNB Bank ASA and Luminor MiCom AB. The Luminor Bank’s registered legal address is Liivalaia 45, 10145,  Tallinn, \\r\\nEstonian Republic. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 1st, 2017 Nordea Bank AB (Swedish company registration No 516406-0120) and DNB Bank ASA (Org. No. 984 851 \\r\\n006) after all regulatory approvals and competition clearance were received, have combined their Baltic business into a \\r\\njointly owned bank, Luminor. By business transfer Nordea Bank AB Lithuania branch, Nordea Bank AB Latvia branch and \\r\\nNordea Bank AB Estonia branch assets and liabilities, including shares of leasing, pension and distressed assets companies \\r\\nin Baltics were transferred to Luminor Bank AB (prev. AB DNB bankas), Luminor Bank AS in Latvia (prev. DNB banka AS) and \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS in Estonia (prev. Aktsiaselts DNB Pank). \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018 an internal corporate restructuring of Luminor Group has been taken place with an aim to concentrate the entire \\r\\nBaltic businesses of Luminor Group in Luminor Bank AS, a credit institution in Estonia; where Luminor Bank AS in Estonia \\r\\nremains as the acquiring entity while Luminor Bank AB in Lithuania and Luminor Bank AS in Latvia are merged into Luminor \\r\\nBank AS in Estonia and cease to exist. A cross border merger is pursued under Directive (EU) 2017/1132 of the European \\r\\nParliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 relating to certain aspects of company law as implemented in Lithuania, Latvia \\r\\nand Estonia respectively. All assets and liabilities of the respective subsidiaries are, in accordance with the relevant laws, \\r\\ntransferred into the Luminor Bank AS in Estonia as a matter of universal succession, and each subsidiary ceased to exist as \\r\\na legal entity upon registration of the cross-border merger.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries \\r\\nthrough the Estonian registered bank and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all assets, \\r\\nrights and liabilities of Luminor Latvia and Luminor Lithuania were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank will \\r\\ncontinue the same activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current annual report, “Bank” (or Luminor Bank AS) refers to Luminor Bank AS. “Group” refers to the consolidated \\r\\nfinancial statements of Luminor Bank AS and its subsidiaries.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 December 2018 Bank owned following subsidiaries: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Liising AS  (leasing and factoring activities), \\r\\n• Luminor Pensions Estonia AS  (management of funds), \\r\\n• Promano Est OÜ (real estate managment), \\r\\n• Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ (real estate management), \\r\\n• Luminor Kindlustusmaakler OÜ ( insurance brokerage). \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 December 2018 the Bank owned 100%  of the share capital of all subsidiaries. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n18 \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 2. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (the Bank or the Group) was prepared in accordance with \\r\\nIAS 34 Interim Financial reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed interim financial information does not \\r\\ncontain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction \\r\\nwith the Group’s annual financial statements as at 31 December 2017. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed interim financial information are consistent with those \\r\\nfollowed in the preparation of the Group’s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, except for the \\r\\naccounting policy of Hedge Accounting and the new accounting standards which came into force from 1 January 2018 and \\r\\nare described below. \\r\\n\\r\\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nHedge Accounting \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which it \\r\\nwishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged \\r\\nand how the Group will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the \\r\\nanalysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for \\r\\nhedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• There is ‘an economic relationship’ between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.  \\r\\n• The effect of credit risk does not ‘dominate the value changes’ that result from that economic relationship.  \\r\\n• The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the \\r\\n\\r\\nGroup actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity \\r\\nof hedged item.  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe Group applies fair value hedge. Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized \\r\\nasset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. The change in the fair \\r\\nvalue of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is \\r\\nalso recognized in the statement of profit or loss.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortized cost, any adjustment to carrying value is amortized through \\r\\nprofit or loss over the remaining term of the hedge using the effective interest (EIR) method. The EIR amortization may begin \\r\\nas soon as an adjustment exists and no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value \\r\\nattributable to the risk being hedged.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the hedged item is derecognized, the unamortized fair value is recognized immediately in profit or loss. When an \\r\\nunrecognized firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the \\r\\nfirm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognized as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss \\r\\nrecognized in profit or loss. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n19 \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 9 as issued by the IASB in July 2014 with a date of adoption of 1 January 2018, which resulted \\r\\nin changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. The \\r\\nGroup did not early-adopt IFRS 9 in previous periods. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group elected not to restate comparative figures. Any adjustment \\r\\nto the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained \\r\\nearnings of the current period. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in the changes in accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement \\r\\nof financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets.  \\r\\n\\r\\nClassification and measurement \\r\\n\\r\\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component (determined \\r\\nin accordance with IFRS 15) at their transaction price. Other financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at initial \\r\\nrecognition at their fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit \\r\\nor loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability. \\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent measurement of the financial assets depends on the classification performed by the Group at initial recognition. \\r\\nAt initial recognition, financial assets can be classified into one of the following categories: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, \\r\\n• Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), \\r\\n• Financial assets measured at amortised cost. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nClassification is performed based on both the Group’s business model for managing financial assets and the characteristics \\r\\nof contractual cash flows of the financial assets. However, financial assets that meet the amortised cost or fair value through \\r\\nother comprehensive income measurement criteria, may be designated on initial recognition by the Group to fair value \\r\\nthrough profit or loss measurement option, provided that particular qualifying criteria are met. Additionally, the Group may \\r\\nmake an irrevocable election at initial recognition for particular investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be \\r\\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified into one of the following categories: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, \\r\\n• Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nA financial liability is classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss if: \\r\\n\\r\\n• It meets the definition of “held for trading” and \\r\\n• It is designated upon initial recognition to fair value through the profit or loss measurement option. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nAll other financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost. \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment of financial assets \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 fundamentally changed the credit loss recognition methodology. The standard replaced IAS 39’s incurred loss \\r\\napproach with a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. The Bank is required to recognize an allowance for \\r\\nexpected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n20 \\r\\n\\r\\nguarantee contracts. The allowance is based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default in the \\r\\nnext twelve months unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance \\r\\nis based on the probability of default over the life of the asset. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are \\r\\ncalculated also for purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) regardless of the changes in credit risk during the \\r\\nlifetime of an instrument. The Bank has established a policy to perform an assessment at the end of each reporting period \\r\\nof whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by considering the change in the risk of default \\r\\noccurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe assets to test for impairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 \\r\\nincludes assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk or which are classified as low risk (rating \\r\\ncategorised as “Investment grade” or higher), stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit \\r\\nrisk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets. Significant assets in stage 3 are tested for impairment on an individual basis, while \\r\\nfor insignificant assets a collective assessment is performed. In stage 1, the allowances equal the 12-month expected credit \\r\\nloss. In stage 2 and 3, the allowances equal the lifetime expected credit losses.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOne important driver for size of allowances under IFRS 9 is the trigger for transferring an asset from Stage 1 to Stage 2. The \\r\\nBank has decided to use a mix of absolute and relative changes (0.6 p.p. and 2.5 times) in 12-month point-in-time Probability \\r\\nof Default (PD) to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. In addition, customers with \\r\\nforbearance measures, included on the watch list and contracts with payments more than thirty days past due are also \\r\\ntransferred to Stage 2. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe agreed IFRS 9 impairment methodology is documented in internal procedures and applied in daily life. Integration into \\r\\nfront office business processes follows and is intended to be finalized during the year 2018, but this does not impact \\r\\nimpairment calculation. In general, IFRS 9 impairment model results in earlier recognition of credit losses for the respective \\r\\nitems and increases the amount of loss allowances recognised for these items. Moreover, the impairment calculations under \\r\\nIFRS 9 are more volatile and pro-cyclical than under IAS 39, mainly due to the significant subjectivity applied in the forward-\\r\\nlooking scenarios. IFRS 9 impairment requirements are applied retrospectively, with transition impact recognized in retained \\r\\nearnings at 1 January 2018.  \\r\\n\\r\\nImpact of the adoption of IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nSet out below are disclosures relating to the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nClassification and measurement of financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement category and the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 and IFRS 9 \\r\\nas at January 2018 are compared as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets \\r\\nT EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal measurement \\r\\ncategory under IAS 39 \\r\\n\\r\\nNew measurement \\r\\ncategory under IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nIAS 39 carrying \\r\\namount 31 Dec 2017 \\r\\n\\r\\nNew carrying amount \\r\\nunder IFRS 9 1 Jan 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with \\r\\ncentral banks \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables Amortised cost 199 250 199 250 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables Amortised cost 148 893 148 888 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair \\r\\nvalue through profit or \\r\\nloss \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at FVTPL  Financial assets at \\r\\nFVTPL  \\r\\n\\r\\n4 526 4 526 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivatives Fair value through profit \\r\\nor loss \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value through \\r\\nprofit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\n4 161 iu2 144 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables Loans and receivables Amortised cost 3 221 001 3 210 268 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n21 \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no changes for classification and measurement of financial liabilities.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities \\r\\nT EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal measurement \\r\\ncategory under IAS 39 \\r\\n\\r\\nNew measurement \\r\\ncategory under IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nIAS 39 carrying amount  \\r\\n31 Dec 2017 \\r\\n\\r\\nNew carrying amount \\r\\nunder IFRS 9 1 Jan 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivatives Fair value through profit or loss \\r\\nFair value through profit \\r\\nor loss 4 161 3 310 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nReconciliation of impairment allowance balance from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following table reconciles the prior period’s closing impairment allowance measured in accordance with the IAS 39 \\r\\nincurred loss model to the new impairment allowance measured in accordance with the IFRS 9 expected loss model as at 1 \\r\\nJanuary 2018: \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets \\r\\nT EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nLoss allowance under IAS \\r\\n39/Provision under IAS 37 Reclassifications Remeasurements \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit loss allowance \\r\\nunder IFRS 9 \\r\\n\\r\\nAmortised cost         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with \\r\\ncentral banks -

IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model that \\r\\nwill apply to revenue earned from a contract with a customer (with limited exceptions), regardless of the type of revenue \\r\\ntransaction or the industry. The standard’s requirements also apply to the recognition and measurement of gains and losses \\r\\non the sale of some non-financial assets that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities (e.g., sales of property, \\r\\nplant and equipment or intangibles). Extensive disclosures will be required, including disaggregation of total revenue; \\r\\ninformation about performance obligations; changes in contract asset and liability account balances between periods and \\r\\nkey judgments and estimates. Management has assessed that the application of the standard did not have any effect on the \\r\\nGroup financial statements.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe core principle of IFRS 15 is that revenue must be recognised to reflect the transfer of services to customers at an \\r\\namount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for such services. This core principle is \\r\\napplied through a five-step model: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. Identify the contract with the customer,  \\r\\n\\r\\n2. Identify the performance obligation in the contract, \\r\\n\\r\\n3. Determine the transaction price, \\r\\n\\r\\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract, \\r\\n\\r\\n5. Recognise revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n23 \\r\\n\\r\\nFor each performance obligation identified, the Group determines at contract inception whether it satisfies the \\r\\nperformance obligation over time or at a point in time, and whether the consideration is fixed or variable, including whether \\r\\nconsideration is constrained due to external factors. Consideration is subsequently allocated to the identified performance \\r\\nobligation.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor services provided over time, consideration is recognised when the service is provided to the customer assuming that a \\r\\nsignificant reversal of consideration will not occur. Examples of income earned for services satisfied over time include the \\r\\nfee income earned for the asset management services.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf a performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time, then the income is recognised when the service is transferred to \\r\\nthe customer. Examples of such income include fee income for executing transactions (clearing and settlement, customers’ \\r\\nsecurities trading, payment cards transaction fees). \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Clarifications) \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Clarifications apply for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 with earlier application permitted. The \\r\\nobjective of the Clarifications is to clarify the IASB’s intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from \\r\\nContracts with Customers, particularly the accounting of identifying performance obligations amending the wording of the \\r\\n“separately identifiable” principle, of principal versus agent considerations including the assessment of whether an entity is \\r\\na principal or an agent as well as applications of control principles and of licensing providing additional guidance for \\r\\naccounting of intellectual property and royalties. The Clarifications also provide additional practical expedients for entities \\r\\nthat either apply IFRS 15 fully retrospectively or that elect to apply the modified retrospective approach. As described above, \\r\\nmanagement has assessed that the application of the standard did not have any material effect on the Group financial \\r\\nstatements. \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 Leases \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. All leases \\r\\nresult in the lessee obtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and, if lease payments are made over time, \\r\\nalso obtaining financing. Accordingly, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance \\r\\nleases as is required by IAS 17 and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Lessees will be required to \\r\\nrecognise: (a) assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low \\r\\nvalue; and (b) depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the income statement. IFRS 16 \\r\\nsubstantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its \\r\\nleases as operating leases or finance leases, and to account for those two types of leases differently. The Group decided \\r\\nthat it will apply the standard using the modified retrospective method. The Group recognised a right of use asset of  4,998 \\r\\nthousand Euro against a corresponding lease liability of 5,337 thousand Euro on 1 January 2019, the impact to the equity as \\r\\nof 1st of January 2019 amounts to 339 thousand Euro. \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 3. RISK MANAGEMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures \\r\\nrequired in the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with the Group's annual financial statements \\r\\nas at 31 December 2017.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been no major changes in the risk management or in any risk management policies since year’s end. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n24 \\r\\n\\r\\nKEY JUDGMENTS, INPUTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES USED FOR ASSESSING EXPECTED \\r\\nCREDIT LOSSES \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the adoption of IFRS 9, a three-stage model was introduced: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Stage 1 – part of the portfolio for which no significant deterioration in credit quality has occurred since initial \\r\\nrecognition (or the exposure is of low credit risk) and the financial instrument is not considered credit-impaired; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Stage 2 – part of the portfolio for which significant deterioration in credit quality has occurred since initial recognition, \\r\\nevidenced by the SICR – significant increase in credit risk – indicator, and the financial instrument is not considered \\r\\ncredit-impaired; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Stage 3 – credit-impaired part of the portfolio. Luminor equates default and credit-impairment definitions so that all \\r\\ndefaulted exposures are treated as credit-impaired and all credit-impaired exposures are treated as defaulted. This \\r\\napproach is based on the fact that the default definition used by the Bank covers all events indicated by IFRS 9 as \\r\\npossible evidence that financial instrument is credit-impaired and all of these events are considered by Luminor as \\r\\nhaving a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows from the instrument. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditional category is POCI financial assets - financial assets that were purchased or originated as credit-impaired. POCI \\r\\nassets are subject to unchanging classification, i.e. financial asset once classified as POCI remains in this group until \\r\\nderecognized. The POCI classification is determined at the financial instrument level. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor applies low credit risk exemption to the following classes of exposures: \\r\\n\\r\\n• central governments, \\r\\n• central bank, \\r\\n• regional governments, \\r\\n• local authorities, \\r\\n• institutions. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe counterparty must fulfil the condition of having a credit rating indicating investment grade. \\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, the financial asset is treated as facing significant increase in credit risk if at least one of the following SICR \\r\\nindicators is identified after initial recognition of the financial instrument and was not present as of its origination: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Significant increase of 12-month PD – significant increase of point-in-time (PIT) forward-looking 12-month PD since \\r\\ninitial recognition until reporting date (2.5 times and 0.6 p.p. jointly), \\r\\n\\r\\n• Risk grade 9 or 10 – risk grade 9 or 10 as of reporting date, \\r\\n• 30 days past due – more than 30 days past due as of reporting date, \\r\\n• Forborne performing – forborne performing status as of reporting date (forbearance not triggering non-performing \\r\\n\\r\\nstatus) in accordance with FINREP instruction reporting requirements, \\r\\n• Watch list – watch list status as of reporting date. \\r\\n \\r\\nAll of the SICR indicators are recognized at financial instrument level in order to track changes in credit risk since initial \\r\\nrecognition date for a particular financial instrument, even though some of them refer to the customer’s characteristics. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor identifies default when either or both of the following default indicators have taken place:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• The customer is more than 90 days past due on any material obligation to the Bank; \\r\\n• The customer is considered unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank.  \\r\\n \\r\\nFor exposure to banks, the default is recognized when payments are due more than 7 days. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n25 \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of identifying unlikelihood of payment,  the elements taken as indications of unlikelihood of payment \\r\\ninclude the following: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Distressed restructuring of credit obligation (forbearance triggering non-performing status in accordance with FINREP \\r\\ninstruction requirements);  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Major financial problems of the customer (present or expected), i.e. significant financial difficulties; \\r\\n• Recognition of specific credit risk adjustment resulting from a significant decline in credit quality of the exposure; \\r\\n• Bankruptcy of the customer or similar protection; \\r\\n• Disappearance of an active market for a financial asset because of the financial difficulties of the customer; \\r\\n• Sell of credit obligation at material credit-related economic loss; \\r\\n• Purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses; \\r\\n• Credit fraud; \\r\\n• External rating indicating default. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe default is recognised at the customer level. \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn to a non-defaulted status is possible not earlier than after 3 months when all default triggers cease to be met. During \\r\\nthese 3 months of the probation period, the timely payments by the customer should be ensured. The exemption from the \\r\\ngeneral rule of probation is distressed restructuring where at least 1 year needs to pass since the moment that restructuring \\r\\nmeasures were extended and the moment when a customer is deemed to have an ability to comply with the post-\\r\\nrestructuring conditions. This approach is consistent with FINREP instruction requirements for treatment of forborne non-\\r\\nperforming exposures. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the shift from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 approach, the incurred loss model was replaced by the expected credit loss (ECL) model. \\r\\nFor Stage 1 financial assets, loss allowances equal the 12-month ECL while for Stage 2 and Stage 3 financial instruments, \\r\\nlifetime ECL is calculated.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Purchased or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI) financial assets, ECL is estimated in the lifetime horizon until the \\r\\nmaturity. The loss expected at initial recognition is referred to as Initial impairment. In subsequent periods, only the \\r\\ncumulative changes in the lifetime expected credit losses since initial recognition are recognised in profit or loss. Collective \\r\\nassessment of impairment is performed for all financial instruments that are not defaulted as of the reporting date, i.e. are \\r\\nclassified as either Stage 1 or Stage 2 or are non-defaulted POCI asset. The expected loss is calculated as the probability-\\r\\nweighted average of losses expected in different macroeconomic scenarios. Expected loss in concrete macroeconomic \\r\\nscenario is calculated as the multiple of probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and \\r\\ncumulative prepayment rate and is discounted using the effective interest rate. PD curves, LGD curves and EAD curves are \\r\\nestimated for all months until the maturity date of the facility. If the facility is classified as Stage 1, expected losses are \\r\\nestimated over the period of up to 12 months. If the facility is classified as Stage 2, then the expected loss is estimated over \\r\\nthe period up to maturity date of the facility. \\r\\n\\r\\nEstimation of PD and LGD curves take into account forward-looking macroeconomic information. The methodology of \\r\\nestimation of these risk parameters includes modelling of the relationship between risk parameters and macroeconomic \\r\\nvariables. Forecasts of macroeconomic variables under different scenarios for 3 upcoming years together with scenario \\r\\nprobabilities are prepared by Luminor macroeconomists. Three macroeconomic scenarios are considered: the \\r\\nbaseline/realistic, positive, and pessimistic scenarios (with the probability weights of 60%, 25% and 15% respectively). \\r\\nMacroeconomic scenarios that are prepared for the estimation of expected losses are consistent with scenarios which are \\r\\nused in credit risk stress testing process. Macroeconomic variables that are included in the modelling are annual change in \\r\\nreal GDP, unemployment rate and annual change of residential real estate price. Starting from the fourth year. it is assumed \\r\\nthat risk parameters (PD and LGD) converge to their long-term average levels. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n26 \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stage 3 exposures (or defaulted POCI assets), which are classified as material, Luminor evaluates the impairment amount \\r\\non individual basis (individual assessment) under discounted cash flows (DCF) method. Two scenarios – base case and risk \\r\\ncase – are used. For exceptional cases, usage of one scenario can be sufficient. The circumstances when only one scenario \\r\\nmight be acceptable could be the deep workout case or the case when total exposure of defaulted borrower falls below \\r\\nthe materiality threshold. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Stage 3 exposures (or defaulted POCI assets), which are classified as immaterial, Luminor evaluates the impairment \\r\\namount on collective basis (collective assessment). Impairment is calculated applying the pool rate for the unsecured part. \\r\\nDifferent pool rates are applied for these pools distinguished by Luminor: \\r\\n\\r\\n• mortgage loans and private credits to private individuals, \\r\\n• consumer loans and other loans to private individuals (including leasing), \\r\\n• SMEs (all financial instruments to legal entities). \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 4. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new expected loss approach model had a negative impact on the Bank’s regulatory capital. By  decision of the Board \\r\\nof Directors of Luminor Group AB, the Bank did not apply transitional arrangements allowed by EU Regulation 2017/2395 \\r\\nand recognised the full effect of the implementation of IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. The capital adequacy ratio is still \\r\\nsignificantly above the regulatory minimum and in line with the internal Risk Appetite statement. \\r\\n\\r\\n T EUR 31 Dec 2018 31 Dec 2017 \\r\\n\\r\\nOWN FUNDS     \\r\\n\\r\\n1.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. \\r\\nWhere the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be \\r\\nderived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of \\r\\nmathematical models. The inputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but where \\r\\nobservable market data is not available, judgment is required to establish fair values.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of loans to customers, customer deposits, amounts due from credit institutions and amounts due to credit \\r\\ninstitutions and other financial assets and liabilities, obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash \\r\\nflows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn assessing the fair value for financial assets, the management has performed discounted cash flow analysis; up-to-date \\r\\nmarket information at the moment of assessment is used for assessing cash flows. For loans, where base interest rates are \\r\\npegged to floating market interest rates, the Group has considered the difference between the average interest margin of \\r\\nissued loans and average interest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has not \\r\\nbeen changed (increased) since issuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal \\r\\nto fair value. \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value of financial liabilities at amortized cost such as Loans and deposits from credit institutions and Deposits from \\r\\ncustomers which are not on demand have been estimated based on discounted cash flow model using interest rates for \\r\\nsimilar products as at period’s end. Fair value of those financial liabilities that are on demand or have floating interest rate \\r\\nhave been estimated to be approximately equal to its carrying amount. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n31 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe table below summarizes the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank financial assets and liabilities accounted for \\r\\nat fair value. Financial instruments are distributed by 3 levels of fair value: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \\r\\n• Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value     measurement is \\r\\n\\r\\ndirectly or indirectly observable. \\r\\n• Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is \\r\\n\\r\\nunobservable. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of all Bank contracted derivatives  is defined as level 2. These are interest rate swaps and in all cases pricing \\r\\nis based on market observable inputs. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no movements of financial instruments between the levels during 2018 and 2017. \\r\\n\\r\\nValuation of all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value was performed as at 31 December 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\n  Fair value measurement using \\r\\n\\r\\n T EUR Date of valuation \\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\n\\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets 31.12.2018     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash balances with \\r\\ncentral banks \\r\\n\\r\\n 701 963 0 0 701 963 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n 0 0 109 208 109 208 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments  0 2 330 0 2 330 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\nthrough profit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\n 0 4 356 0 4 356 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables  0 0 3 212 788 3 212 788 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   701 963 6 686 3 321 996 4 030 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities 31.12.2018     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n 0 0 1 471 984 1 471 984 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers  0 0 1 724 550 1 724 550 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued  0 351 235 0 351 235 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments  0 2 312 0 2 312 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   0 353 547 3 196 534 3 550 081 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets 31.12.2017     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash balances with \\r\\ncentral banks \\r\\n\\r\\n 199 250 0 0 199 250 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit \\r\\ninstitutions (demand)  \\r\\n\\r\\n 0 0 92 832 92 832 \\r\\n\\r\\nReceivables from parent pledged \\r\\nas collateral \\r\\n\\r\\n 0 0 37 647 37 647 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n32 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments  0 4 161 0 4 161 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\nthrough profit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\n 0 4 526 0 4 526 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables  0 0 3 239 414 3 239 414 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   199 250 8 687 3 374 419 3 577 830 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities 31.12.2017     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2017 0 0 1 397 509 1 397 509 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers  0 0 1 648 598 1 648 598 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued  0 0 65 007 65 007 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments  0 4 161 0 4 161 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   0 4 161 3 111 114 3 115 275 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nDemand deposits due from credit institutions and loans and receivables to customers are issued on market conditions. \\r\\nTherefore, the fair value of these financial assets does not materially differ from their carrying amount as at 31 December \\r\\n2018 and 31 December 2017.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF PERFORMANCE OF OPERATING SEGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief \\r\\nOperating Decision Maker (CODM), as required by IFRS 8. At Luminor, the CODM has been defined as Group Executive \\r\\nManagement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Executive Management Committee monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of \\r\\nmaking decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on \\r\\noperating profits or losses and is measured consistently with operating profits or losses in the consolidated financial \\r\\nstatements. Interest income is reported net as management primarily relies on net interest revenue as a performance \\r\\nmeasure, along with the gross income and expense. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 October 2017, Luminor Group implemented new reportable operating segments, and therefore there is no \\r\\ncomparable data with respective segmentation for previous periods.  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n35 \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF SEGMENTATION \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the four main business areas: Corporate Banking, Business Clients, Household and Private \\r\\nBanking.

The Household segment serves Luminor’s household customers in the \\r\\nBaltic markets, through various channels offering a full range of financial services and solutions. The business area includes \\r\\nadvisory and service staff, channels, product units, back office and IT under a common strategy, operating model and \\r\\ngovernance across markets.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking provides high-quality investment, savings and risk management products. It also manages customers’ assets \\r\\nand gives financial advice to affluent and high net worth individuals as well as to institutional investors.

TAX \\r\\n\\r\\nStarting from 1 April 2018, the quarterly profits of credit institutions are subject to corporate income tax at the rate of 14%. \\r\\nThe tax is payable by the 10th day of the third month of the following quarter. Once the profits are distributed, an additional \\r\\nincome tax of up to 6% is further payable, which adds up to the total tax rate of up to 20%. The rate of the additional tax \\r\\ndepends on the regularity of the dividend payments. If no dividends are paid, the advance tax payments are not \\r\\nrefunded.  Advance income tax was first time applied to the bank’s profit for 2018 Q2 in the amount of 1 144 thousand euros. \\r\\nAs of 31 December 2018 the advance income tax payable was recognized in the amount of 305 thousand euros. \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTE 19.

The COVID-19 \\r\\npandemic made us swiftly readjust the priorities that we had set for the year, with ensuring the safety of our employees and customers \\r\\nbecoming our main focus.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is an important part of the Baltic economy. We continue to offer banking services and financial infrastructure in our home \\r\\nmarkets even under the emergency situations declared by the Baltic governments, while taking comprehensive measures to assure \\r\\nthe safety of our employees and customers. We are helping to mitigate the economic harm caused by the pandemic by offering \\r\\nsimplified grace period solutions for both private individuals and corporate customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nCollaboration is one of Luminor’s core values and we view it as vitally important both in dealing efficiently with the current situation \\r\\nand in preparing to come out of it. Luminor has taken an active role in developing the measures that the Baltic governments have \\r\\nprepared for stimulating the economies and mitigating the impact of COVID-19. We will use state guarantees to provide investment \\r\\nand working capital loans to companies in all three countries and we are also investigating how we can participate in the guarantee \\r\\nprogrammes offered by the European Investment Fund.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor started the year with a significantly improved funding position and we fully intend to use our strong financial standing for \\r\\nthe benefit of our customers. We have introduced a new operating model and made our operations more efficient, so we were \\r\\nstronger and nimbler when the crisis hit, which allowed us to adapt quickly to the changing circumstances. We continued to improve \\r\\nour funding structure in the first quarter of 2020 and we have brought the loan-to-deposit ratio down to 99.7% from 108.4% a year \\r\\nago. The underlying business performance without extraordinary expenses has improved as well. There was a net loss in the first \\r\\nquarter of 21.2 million EUR that was due mainly to provisions for credit impairments caused by the spread of COVID-19.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 4 March, Luminor issued the first covered bonds from the Baltic region, for 500 million EUR, with an interest rate spread over mid-\\r\\nswap of 0.25% and a final yield of -0.18%. This set the record for the lowest-ever rate paid by a non-government issuer from the \\r\\nBaltics. The funds received were used to broaden our funding base and to increase our liquidity buffers further. \\r\\n\\r\\nRemote services have become additionally important for health and safety reasons during the current crisis. We have put more people \\r\\nin our call centres to advise our customers, and we launched remote customer onboarding in Latvia in the first quarter of this year, \\r\\nwhich made us the first bank in the country to provide this service fully remotely. The service will be extended to Lithuania and Estonia \\r\\nduring 2020. Another step in promoting our online business was the launch of the e-Commerce Gateway, an acquiring solution for \\r\\nonline merchants in all three Baltic countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is also making good progress in becoming independent from the networks and payment systems of our former parent banks. \\r\\nIn the first quarter of this year, we finished setting up independent payment infrastructure on all the core banking systems in the \\r\\nthree countries. We are also making strong headway with the carveout on international payment flows processed through the Nordea \\r\\nGroup, and we plan to become fully independent on those payments during the first half of 2020. Although current circumstances \\r\\nforced us to revisit our migration schedule at the end of March, the process of moving our customer accounts to the targeted unified \\r\\nsystems is progressing, and it should be finalised in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in 2020. Luminor Retail Banking increased its presence \\r\\nin the housing loan market by 5% and continued to focus on balanced active sales of lending products and on attracting customer \\r\\ndeposits in the first quarter of 2020, but market fluctuations caused by the first impacts of the current pandemic were already being \\r\\nwitnessed at the end of March. Corporate Banking focused on measures to help our customers cope with the heavy blow dealt to \\r\\ntheir business developments by the outbreak of the virus. More than 24 million EUR of provisions for credit losses were set up in \\r\\nCorporate Banking in the first quarter, with 90% of those provisions in response to the expected impact of COVID-19 on the financial \\r\\nstanding of our customers and to sharply lower oil prices.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe distress caused in financial markets by the pandemic has also impacted pension assets under management, which fell to 1.3 \\r\\nbillion EUR. This is down 11% from the end of 2019 and is at the same level as a year before. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor remains committed to our proactive and vigilant stance in detecting and preventing money laundering and terrorism \\r\\nfinancing, and in the first quarter of 2020 we continued to enhance our financial crime risk management framework. \\r\\n\\r\\nLike the rest of the euro area, the Baltics are preparing to take a hit from the economic impact of the health crisis and the ensuing \\r\\nlockdown of economies. It is of the utmost importance that we start focusing on how those economies will recover, with the aid of \\r\\nsubstantial support from both the EU and national governments. The Baltic banks are well capitalised with stronger balance sheets \\r\\nand can be part of the solution by extending liquidity and keeping the credit flowing to the real economy. Intensive work is being \\r\\ndone at Luminor to prepare for how the economic lockdown will impact the economy. We are strengthening the organisational \\r\\ncapabilities that will let us support our customers, we are working with different scenarios for how the crisis will evolve and for the \\r\\neconomic impact it will have, we are reviewing our costs and financial plans, and we are doing much more besides. More importantly, \\r\\nwe are preparing for how we can contribute to restarting the economy.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 4  \\r\\n\\r\\nI am very grateful to the entire Luminor team, who have responded wonderfully well in dealing with these extraordinary \\r\\ncircumstances and ensuring the vital banking services and support that our customers need, while also preparing for how we will exit \\r\\nthis crisis. Building tomorrow starts today. \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\n\\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 5  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral information \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor) was established on 1 October 2017 through the merger of the Baltic operations of DNB Bank ASA \\r\\n(Commercial Register no. 984 851 006, DNB) and Nordea Bank Abp (Commercial Register no. 2858394-9, Nordea) to create a new-\\r\\ngeneration financial service provider for local businesses and financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 it was announced that the transaction signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB, Nordea and US-based \\r\\nprivate equity firm Blackstone had been concluded and as a result a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone \\r\\nacquired a 60.1% majority stake in the bank. The bank’s initial owners Nordea and DNB each retained a 19.95% equity stake in \\r\\nLuminor, but an arrangement has been made by the consortium and Nordea for the purchase of Nordea’s remaining stake over the \\r\\ncoming years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with some 900 000 clients, 2 501 employees, and market share \\r\\nof 16.0% in deposits and 18.0% in lending as at the end of March 2020. Luminor has total shareholders’ equity of 1.6 billion EUR and \\r\\nit is capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 20.5%. Luminor’s core business is serving entrepreneurial people in the Baltics with a primary \\r\\nfocus on local companies and the financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers its customers a wide range of products and services through all possible channels, digital and physical, with 34 \\r\\ncustomer service centres in total in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, of which nine are meet-up points. Luminor owns 357 ATMs \\r\\nthroughout the Baltic states, and additionally provides services through 100 ATMs in partnership with other financial services \\r\\nproviders.  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Estonia Latvia Lithuania GroupGr Total  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of customers ~132 000 ~226 000 ~566 000 ~924 000 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket shares      \\r\\n\\r\\nLending 12.9% 22.9% 19.7% 18.0% \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits 8.7% 17.2% 20.9% 16.0% \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of client service \\r\\ncentres, including meet- up \\r\\npoints \\r\\n\\r\\n8 10 16 34  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of employees 600 875 1 026 2 501 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is clear by now that the COVID-19 outbreak will have significant economic implications, although it is hard to predict the length and \\r\\nseverity of its impact. The consensus outlook for global growth for 2020 is clearly negative, with a recovery coming only in 2021. The \\r\\nimpact on the Baltic economies is likely to be concentrated in the second and third quarters of the year, and that impact will be \\r\\nsevere, but temporary.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, however, a significant degree of uncertainty in how the gradual re-opening of the economies will impact the spreading of \\r\\nthe virus. The Baltic states were quick at closing borders and imposing social distancing, and hence currently have fatalities per million \\r\\ninhabitants which are less than 5% of the levels seen in large parts of Europe (e.g. the UK, France, Benelux). Whether this is indicative \\r\\nof a more successful strategy of protecting public health, or whether we are looking at a more prolonged impact from the virus in the \\r\\nBaltics, is too early to say.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe experience of other countries hit by COVID-19 suggests that growth will drop substantially in the Baltic economies in the near \\r\\nterm, as both production and consumption is negatively impacted by the measures needed to contain the virus, and from the \\r\\ndisruption of global supply chains. Sharp recessions in the Baltic economies, concentrated to the second quarter, are very likely, but \\r\\nshould be followed by a gradual recovery from Q3 onwards. Some of the key trading partners for the Baltic states, including Germany \\r\\nand Denmark, have already taken the first steps towards a gradual reopening of their economies. GDP growth in the euro area, the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 6  \\r\\n\\r\\nkey destination for Baltic exports, however decelerated noticeably already in the end of 2019, to only 1% in the fourth quarter \\r\\ncompared to a year earlier, being dragged down by lower activity levels in manufacturing and trade.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe economic expansion in the Baltic states has been robust in recent years, with GDP growth outpacing the euro area average by a \\r\\nsignificant margin. In addition, in stark contrast to the situation going into the Global Financial Crisis, Baltic private as well as public \\r\\nsector debt in relation to GDP is among the lowest in Europe, which may cusion the economic shock from the pandemic. Domestic \\r\\ndemand and business activity held up well in the region until the pandemic started, with very tight labour markets supporting high-\\r\\nsingle digit wage growth and strong retail sales. However, this strong starting points does not entirely insulate the region’s economies \\r\\nfrom feeling the impact from the pandemic.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has delivered substantial support for the euro area as a whole, and the Baltic countries will benefit \\r\\non top of this from targeted extraordinary fiscal support measures at both the national and EU levels to mitigate the consequences \\r\\nof the crisis. The impact of these measures is yet uncertain however, as the crisis hits subsegments of the economy very differently \\r\\nand the availability of the fiscal support for those sectors mostly hit. There is no doubt that the loss of activity in the coming quarters \\r\\nwill be significant, but it is crucial that the economies can recover swiftly after the spread of the virus has been contained and as the \\r\\ngradual reopening from lockdown proceeds.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19  \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the outbreak of COVID-19, all three Baltic countries declared a state of emergency, and as a result the regular way of living was \\r\\nchanged immediately. Different measures were put in place to decrease the speed of infection, and thereby protect public health, \\r\\nand ensure the stability of the health care system. Many of these measures have had severe effects on regular activities in the \\r\\nsocieties, impacting directly or indirectly businesses and jobs. \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the footsteps of other countries in the world, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian governments have launched programs to  \\r\\nstimulate the economies to mitigate the negative effects from the pandemic. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt large, the state measures put in place can be divided into five major categories, represented in all Baltic countries: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Employment measures – granting limited sums per person to support the individuals, who have lost all or majority of their \\r\\n\\r\\nincome, and companies, to allow them to keep people employed, in order to survive state of emergency; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Tax measures – allowing exemptions or suspension or deductions of tax contributions of private individuals and companies \\r\\n\\r\\nin affected sectors; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Liquidity measures – deferring tax deadlines, granting loan guarantees and loans to companies; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Stimulating the economy – accelerating investment programs and public expenditure, reducing capital adequacy \\r\\n\\r\\nrequirements for financial institutions; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Sector- or company-specific measures – targeted financial support or loans to sectors and companies most heavily impacted \\r\\n\\r\\n(retail, tourism, large employers), important from national interest or recovery perspective (transportation, aviation, etc). \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Estonia, the state-owned financial institution KredEx is providing capital loans and investment loans, and offers extraordinary loan \\r\\nguarantees in co-operation with banks since the end of March. KredEx targets specific sectors and companies hit by pandemic, as well \\r\\nas projects of national importance, covering amounts up to 5 million EUR per company.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Latvia, the loan guarantees and liquidity loans are provided by state-owned financial institution ALTUM, directly and in cooperation \\r\\nwith commercial banks. Latvia has also introduced number of measures to support retail companies to survive the crisis. There are \\r\\ndifferent tax related measures implemented in Latvia, including repayment of overpaid VAT.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLithuania has introduced a 5 billion EUR “Economic and Financial Action Plan” to support the economy, maintain business liquidity, \\r\\njobs, and healthcare. As an example, small fixed payouts are distributed to self-employed people affected by the state of emergency. \\r\\nLithuania is also injecting 1 billion EUR into the economy by accelerating investment programs, and has introduced a number of tax \\r\\nand consumption-oriented measures.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, there are number of measures targeted at banks - banks can operate temporarily below the level of capital defined by \\r\\nthe Pillar 2 Guidance, the capital conservation buffer and the liquidity coverage ratio requirements, or use capital instruments that \\r\\ndo not qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 instruments. In addition, the countercyclical capital buffer and/or systemic risk buffer \\r\\nrequirements have been reduced. The ECB has eased conditions for targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) and added \\r\\nsome funding possibilities for banks (including the Pandemic Emergency Funding Facility). \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 7  \\r\\n\\r\\nBeing an important part of the Baltic economies, in order to support our customers in this difficult time and offer best financial advice, \\r\\nLuminor has kept its customer service centers open, though strict measures have been adopted to protect our employees and \\r\\ncustomers – we are more frequently cleaning the facilities and ATM’s, we have put in place mandatory facemasks and safety screens \\r\\nfor employees, and we also are limiting the number of simultaneous customer visits to service centers. To prevent the spread of virus, \\r\\nover 70% of our employees are working remotely.     \\r\\n\\r\\nTo help our customers withstand the crisis, Luminor offers simplified grace period solutions both to private individuals and corporate \\r\\ncustomers in all three Baltic countries. This means that bank is not asking any additional documents from the customer, not changing \\r\\nthe loan agreement conditions and not taking any fee.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also aim to help distribute the state guaranteed loans, and utilize other potential programs to ensure the availability of investment \\r\\nand working capital loans for companies in all three countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness development \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor completed its cross-border merger on 2 January 2019 and continues its operations in all the three Baltic countries through \\r\\nthe bank headquartered in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all assets, rights and \\r\\nliabilities of Luminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank \\r\\ncontinues its activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches. A new organisational set up and a new \\r\\ngovernance structure were also introduced, and new members of management bodies were appointed.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe deposits and financial instruments of the depositors and customers using the investment services of Luminor Bank AS and its \\r\\nLatvian branch and Lithuanian branch are guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and investor protection scheme established and \\r\\noperated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe process of setting up independent payment infrastructure for all the core banking systems in the three countries was completed \\r\\nin February 2020. Luminor established its own correspondent banks network in 2019 and gained independence in international \\r\\npayments from the correspondent banking accounts of DNB. It is now making good headway with the international payment flows \\r\\nprocessed through the Nordea Group, planning to become independent on payments during the first half of 2020.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe gradual migration of the legacy Nordea customers in Latvia to the Luminor information systems continued in the beginning of \\r\\n2020. The process of finalising the systems and migrating the customers to the targeted unified systems is progressing, with the aim \\r\\nto finalize the migration in all countries during 2020. Even with the ongoing pandemic, this remains one of Luminor’s top priorities \\r\\nfor the year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first quarter of 2020 Luminor continued strengthening its Daily Banking offering with the launch of several new services. Remote \\r\\ncustomer onboarding was launched in Latvia, making Luminor the first bank in the country to provide the service fully remotely. \\r\\nLuminor aims to extent this service to Lithuania and Estonia during the year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor also launched the e-Commerce Gateway, an acquiring solution for online merchants, in all three Baltic states. The e-\\r\\nCommerce Gateway provides card acquiring services for accepting VISA and Mastercard cards, and uses the Open Banking application \\r\\nprogramming interfaces (APIs) of major banks to enable account-to-account payments to be acquired. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor also launched its Black Card in Latvia. This credit card is an excellent value proposition for domestic and overseas use and \\r\\nthe aim is for it to become the target credit card for Luminor customers in all three countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor Investor platform was launched in Estonia in February 2020, following its launch in Latvia and Lithuania in October 2019. \\r\\nThe investment platform is tailored for investors of all levels of experience and offers a wide range of non-complex financial \\r\\ninstruments, with more than 14 500 instruments in total. The platform was built jointly with Scandinavian partners and gives a \\r\\nsimplified customer experience that lets customers build their savings at their own pace. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus of the Retail Banking team remained on achieving balanced sales of our lending products and attracting customer deposits, \\r\\nand it increased the bank’s presence in the housing loan market by 5%, mainly through the Latvian and Lithuanian markets. The \\r\\nmarket share for newly issued consumer loans has increased by some 3% in Latvia and Lithuania, while it declined by 0.4% in the \\r\\nEstonian market. Lending volumes for the mass business customers have remained stable and at the same level as in the first quarter \\r\\nof 2019. The portfolio of deposits of private clients has grown by 4.5% from the same quarter of 2019. By the end of March the Retail \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 8  \\r\\n\\r\\nBanking team was already seeing the first impact of the COVID-19 outbreak as market fluctuations squeezed the assets under \\r\\nmanagement of retail customers by 153 million EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe e-Commerce Gateway was launched for mass business customers at the end of the first quarter and within the first two weeks \\r\\nof launch it had received 52 applications and converted 13 of them into agreements.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team continued to focus on its migration work during the quarter and the first mass business clients were \\r\\nsuccessfully migrated from the legacy Nordea systems to the targeted Luminor unified information systems. The team continued to \\r\\nconsolidate the distribution channels and improve efficiency in related areas. Two service centres were relaunched with a new \\r\\nconcept in the first quarter of 2020 and Luminor was serving its customers in a total of 34 locations across the Baltics.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe top priority for the Corporate Banking team in the first quarter of 2020 was to take measures to help corporate customers cope \\r\\nwith the impact of COVID-19 on their business. More than 24 million EUR of provisions for credit losses were set up in corporate \\r\\nbanking in the first quarter of 2020, and 90% of those provisions were in response to the expected impact of COVID-19 on the financial \\r\\nstanding of clients and to sharply lower oil prices. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lending portfolio decreased by 19% compared to the last year as a result of the repricing and optimisation of the portfolio and \\r\\nslower new sales, partly due to COVID-19. The deposits of corporate customers remained at the same level as in the first quarter of \\r\\n2019, as the Corporate Banking team has been putting more emphasis on improving the quality of deposits by replacing large \\r\\nconcentrated accounts with more diversified SMEs.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income showed solid results as higher market volatility brought along increased customer activity in the risk hedging \\r\\ntransactions. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nWealth Management introduced several new solutions for our customers in the first quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor Investor platform was rolled out in full in all three Baltic states and was promoted to customers interested in financial \\r\\ninvestments, also the new VISA Infinite card for the Private Banking segment was introduced for Latvian and Lithuanian customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness growth and customer satisfaction remained firmly in the focus of the Private Banking and Pensions teams. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe distress caused in financial markets by COVID-19 reduced the pension assets managed to 1.3 billion EUR, which was roughly the \\r\\nsame as a year earlier and 11% down from the end of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the first quarter Luminor had 291 000 second pillar pension customers and 63 000 third pillar customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Private Banking team focused on growing the assets under management and reached 1.37 billion EUR in the first quarter of 2020, \\r\\nwhich was 7% more than in the same quarter of 2019 and 3.6% less than at the end of 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus remains on achieving a high level of customer satisfaction by being available for our customers, and on ensuring operational \\r\\ncommunication in the face of the elevated volatility in financial markets.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe safety and well-being of Luminor employees and customers has been and remains our top priority in all our activities. We at \\r\\nLuminor are keeping our customer service centers open and continuing to offer banking services to our customers even under the \\r\\ncurrent difficult circumstances, but we have taken comprehensive measures to assure the safety of our employees and our customers. \\r\\nThese measures include the maximum possible use of remote work, extra attention to cleaning and the availability of disinfectants in \\r\\nall our facilities and ATM’s, the provision of protective equipment for all our employees, and limits on the number of customer visits \\r\\nto the customer service centers at any one time. \\r\\n\\r\\nRemote services have become especially crucial in the current pandemic, and Luminor has encouraged customers to use digital \\r\\nservices to the greatest extent possible. Working together with our partners, Luminor initiated a community investment project in \\r\\nthe first quarter of 2020 that aims to help local companies take their business online or advance their current e-business capabilities. \\r\\nWe are also currently offering our payment solution e- Commerce Gateway for free so that we can help promote safer e-business. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 9  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapidly changing environment, the large number of unknowns, and the new ways of working can all cause considerable stress. \\r\\nFor that reason, we are paying special attention to communication and consultation with our employees so that we can aid them in \\r\\nadapting to the new circumstances and let them focus on their work and life balance. Separate webinars to share the knowledge we \\r\\nhave gained have been delivered for Luminor customers, covering topics like remote working and cyber security during the current \\r\\ncrisis.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn our concern for environmental sustainability, Luminor developed risk-adjusted environmental and social risk evaluation procedures \\r\\nin the first quarter of 2020 to be applied to all legal entities. The procedure requires E&S evaluation for every new customers and \\r\\nduring every annual review of existing customers with a limit extending EUR 0.5 million. To support this, we ran training courses for \\r\\nthe employees most connected to the topic.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEfficient governance is of great importance to us and so we reviewed and updated Luminor’s governance policies and procedures. An \\r\\naudit was carried out in this that recommended further improvements to the Management Board. \\r\\n\\r\\nEFFORTS TO PREVENT FINANCIAL CRIME  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor remains vigilant and committed to detecting and preventing financial crime, and we regularly review our anti-financial crime \\r\\n(AFC) practices and invest in the human and technological resources that are needed. We work constantly to get a better \\r\\nunderstanding of our customers and their transactions, and to manage and report any potential financial crime risk. Luminor \\r\\npredominantly serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers who have a strong personal or business connection \\r\\nto the Baltic states. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Luminor has further enhanced its financial crime risk management framework to prevent, detect, \\r\\nmanage and report potential financial crime risk, and this has supported its conservative approach towards money laundering and \\r\\nfinancial crime. The framework covers technology, policies and procedures for detecting financial crime, risk assessments, training \\r\\nand awareness-raising, and ongoing monitoring of new and developing financial crime risks. As we are subject to a wide range of legal \\r\\nrequirements, Luminor is transparent in all its activities and works closely with all the supervisory and regulatory authorities. Luminor \\r\\nalso follows the international guidelines, recommendations and standards issued by the regulatory and supervisory authorities, \\r\\ninternational bodies and local banking associations, and the financial intelligence units in each Baltic state. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to invest in its systems and processes so it can adapt in a constantly changing environment. The bank is further \\r\\ndeveloping its common monitoring and screening solution in all three Baltic states and has envisaged several further developments \\r\\nthat are to be delivered during 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor considers that awareness-raising activities are an important component of the financial crime risk management framework. \\r\\nDuring the first quarter, 31 training events related to AFC and corporate compliance areas were held on 10 different topics.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER EVENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 27 Auri Loog joined Luminor as the Head of Internal Audit Division. She is a Certified Internal Auditor with a solid \\r\\nexperience in banking and auditing sectors. The former Head of Internal Audit Jelena Gute went on to lead Luminor’s Group Finance \\r\\nDepartment. \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 31 MARCH 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to be prepared for dealing efficiently and expertly with the additional workload potentially caused by the economic impact \\r\\nof COVID-19 and support our customers also in the most difficult cases, a Credit Advisory and Restructuring division has been \\r\\nestablished as of 1 May 2020. It is a temporary dedicated unit with a planned duration of 18 months with a possible 6-month extension \\r\\nperiod, supporting the current teams working in this field. The Head of the new division is Solvita Deglava. She has strong experience \\r\\nin the restructuring area, having worked in that capacity in different banks. \\r\\n\\r\\n   \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 10  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results \\r\\n\\r\\nNet loss in the first quarter amounted to 21.2 million EUR and was mainly driven by loan loss provisions as a result of the COVID-19 \\r\\npandemic. Loan loss provisions amounted to 26.4 million EUR compared to 7.3 million EUR net reversals in same period last year, \\r\\nresulting in a 1.05% loan loss ratio. \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income in the first quarter was 54.1 million EUR compared to 63.8 million EUR a year ago and was impacted by continued \\r\\nrepricing and rightsizing of the balance sheet. Interest income declined by 3% while the loan portfolio decreased by 12% as a result \\r\\nof planned effort to ensure fair pricing of risk and improve profitability. Interest expense increased by 54% or 5.8 million EUR as a \\r\\nresult of the process to become an independently funded bank and continuous work with funding diversification. Consequently, net \\r\\ninterest income-to-loans ratio in the first quarter was 2.2% compared to 2.3% in the same period last year. Net commission income \\r\\ndecreased by 5% compared to same quarter last year, with one of the key drivers being early signs of lower customer activity due to \\r\\nCOVID-19 pandemic. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses in the first quarter were 71.4 million EUR and have decreased by 1% compared to the same period last year. \\r\\nExceptional costs have increased from 17.2 million EUR in the first quarter last year to 25.3 million EUR this year. In the first quarter \\r\\nthis year the largest part were IT expenses, which constituted 89% and other costs were 11% of total exceptional expenses.

The \\r\\ncomposition has been stable, with deposits from individual customers comprising 40% of the deposit portfolio of Luminor at the Baltic \\r\\nlevel, followed by 39% from business customers and 17% from public sector. Luminor’s share of the deposit market in the Baltics has \\r\\ndecreased from 16.9% to 16.0% over the past 12 months. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 12  \\r\\n\\r\\nASSET QUALITY FOR Q1 2020   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe adverse impact of COVID-19 is reflected in asset quality of Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most severe consequences will most probably be seen in industries like accommodation, tourism, and aviation. Even though \\r\\nLuminor’s portfolio towards these economic sectors is relatively small, negative trends in the portfolio are still observed since many \\r\\nother industries are quite severely affected as well. As a result, requests for modifications (including grace period) reached 0.9 billion \\r\\nEUR at the end of March 2020 and exceeded 1.1 billion EUR (11% of the total credit portfolio) by the middle of April 2020.  \\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the situation, and the generous terms for modifications, the number of modifications has been limited so far.  \\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 70% of modification requests came from business customers. Earlier applications for modification from business \\r\\ncustomers compared to individual customers can be explained by the following reasons: \\r\\n\\r\\n• business customers have been affected first; moreover, professional financial management leads business customers to \\r\\n\\r\\nimmediately approach the bank, if foreseeing the need for modifications;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• individual customers often have unemployment benefits. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest part of modification requests from business customers are for industries like real estate activities, transportation and \\r\\nstorage, wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common modification type is grace period on principal payments. Luminor is restrictive (applying only exceptionally) \\r\\ntowards granting full grace period (including grace on interest payments). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe volume of overdue loans is fluctuating and not yet showing negative trends, however, depending on the development of the \\r\\npandemic and measures taken by governments, this might accelerate in the second quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first quarter, Luminor loan loss provisions reached 26.4 million EUR. Approximately 50% of the provisions was for Stage 3 \\r\\nwhile the rest was for Stage 1 and 2 exposures. Stage 1 and 2 provisions increased mainly due to changes in the macroeconomic \\r\\noutlook in the models, and an increase of watch list customers. 60% of Stage 3 provisions in the period related to new non-performing \\r\\nloans (NPLs). In addition, 30% represented additional provisions on existing NPLs relating to the energy sector. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe share of non-performing loans (NPL ratio) was 3.9% at the end of the quarter, which is an increase of 0.1 percentage points from \\r\\nthe previous quarter. The NPL ratio for the mortgage loans portfolio was unchanged at 2.9%. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal impairment allowances on the balance sheet were 197.2 million EUR at the end of the quarter, of which 142.2 million EUR \\r\\nrelated to Stage 3 exposures. This can be compared with total non-performing loans of 393.5 million EUR.  \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March

A key requirement for achieving this is \\r\\nthat the former parent funding provided in equal parts by DNB and Nordea should gradually be replaced by other forms of funding \\r\\nsuch as deposits and wholesale funding from third parties.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has achieved tangible results in getting closer to being a self-funded banking group. Deposits from customers stood at 9 959 \\r\\nmillion EUR at the end of the first quarter of 2020, and at 10 235 million EUR on 31 December 2019. In March 2020 Luminor issued \\r\\nits inaugural five-year covered bond for 500 million EUR, which received a long-term rating of Aa1 from Moody’s. The covered bond \\r\\nissuance raised the value of bonds outstanding under the EMTN programme to 1 156 million EUR at the end of the first quarter of \\r\\n2020 from 652 million EUR at 31 December 2019. The senior unsecured bonds issued under the EMTN programme have been assigned \\r\\na rating of Baa2 by Moody’s.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to its deposits from customers and wholesale funding, Luminor has outstanding debt facility lines with its former parent \\r\\ncompanies DNB and Nordea. This funding amounted to 150 million EUR at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and was provided in \\r\\nthe form of a syndicate, with each syndicate partner providing 50%. The covered bond issuance meant the total amount committed \\r\\nto the facility under the agreement, used and unused combined, was reduced to 2 337 million EUR as at 31 March 2020 from 2 837 \\r\\nmillion EUR as at 31 December 2019. The amount of the facility is committed for five years from 1 October 2019, initially three years \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 17  \\r\\n\\r\\nwith the option for Luminor to extend it by up to two years, and it can be drawn with maturities of one, two or three years. The facility \\r\\nis partly secured, as Luminor has assigned mortgage loans to it with a carrying value of 1 762 million EUR as at 31 March 2020 and 1 \\r\\n929 million EUR as at 31 December 2019. The total committed but unused credit line was 2 187 million EUR as at the end of the first \\r\\nquarter of 2020 and 1 932 million EUR as at 31 December 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 April 2020 Luminor received its minimum own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) requirement as a decision of the Single \\r\\nResolution Board (SRB) dated 20 December 2019 that was executed for Luminor by the decision of  Finantsinspektsioon, the Estonian \\r\\nFSA, dated 1 April 2020. The MREL decision sets the following MREL requirements for Luminor: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Holding AS (parent company of Luminor Bank AS) shall comply with the MREL at the consolidated level of Luminor \\r\\nBank AS, on a consolidated level of 17.28% of total liabilities and own funds at all times, and 11.97% of total liabilities and \\r\\nown funds shall be met with subordinated instruments; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Holding AS shall have a transitional period until 30 June 2022 to comply with these requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 March 2020 the total MREL ratio stands at 17.0% on the consolidated level of Luminor Bank AS (16.3% as at 31 December \\r\\n2019) and 12.1% of total liabilities and own funds were subordinated instruments (11.5% as at 31 December 2019) . It should be noted \\r\\nthat the MREL requirements have been set using data from 31 March 2019. This means the decision does not consider any subsequent \\r\\nevents.  \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, \\r\\nwith a stable outlook. There have been no changes to Luminor’s ratings since then. On 25 March 2020 Moody’s issued an updated \\r\\ncredit opinion for Luminor.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 March 2020 Moody’s assigned a definitive Aa1 rating to the mortgage covered bonds issued by Luminor Bank AS under the \\r\\nEstonian Covered Bonds Act. \\r\\n\\r\\n  LIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s structural liquidity risk is conservative and well-balanced, and based on metrics to measure liquidity risk, is appropriately \\r\\nadopted to the current economic and regulatory environment. Luminor uses a range of metrics to measure liquidity risk. One metric \\r\\nused is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The LCR for Luminor was 144% as at the end of the first quarter and 150% as at 31 December \\r\\n2019 by the definition of the LCR in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). The liquidity buffer is composed of highly liquid central \\r\\nbank eligible securities and cash. Long-term liquidity risk is measured as the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). As at the end of the first \\r\\nquarter of 2020, Luminor’s NSFR was 126%, while as at 31 December 2019 it was 123%.  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n372\\r\\n\\r\\n4 271\\r\\n3 950\\r\\n\\r\\n1738\\r\\n\\r\\n150\\r\\n\\r\\n1156\\r\\n1610\\r\\n\\r\\nAll other Liabilities Corporate\\r\\n\\r\\ndeposits\\r\\n\\r\\nRetail deposits Public sector\\r\\n\\r\\ndeposits\\r\\n\\r\\nParent Funding Debt securit ies\\r\\n\\r\\nissued\\r\\n\\r\\nEquity\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 18  \\r\\n\\r\\n Q1  2020 Q4  2019 Q3  2019 Q2 2019 Q1  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 143.7% 149.8% 144.3% 132.5% 131.2% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR 126.0% 123.0% 118.0% 127.4% 122.0% \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are predominantly from residents of the Baltics.

As at 31 March 2020 the own funds of Luminor were 1 598 million EUR and \\r\\nas at 31 December 2019 they were 1 572 million EUR, and they were fully composed of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn its Capital Adequacy calculations Luminor uses the standardised method to calculate risk weighted exposure amounts for credit \\r\\nrisk and market risk. Risk weighted exposure amounts for operational risk are calculated using the Basic Indicator Approach method. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 March 2020, the Leverage Ratio, calculated in accordance with the CRR, was 11.5%, and as at 31 December 2019 it was \\r\\n10.9%. The leverage ratio is calculated as total Tier 1 own funds divided by the total risk exposure measure, including the risk position \\r\\non assets and off-balance-sheet liabilities. \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital ratios  \\r\\n\\r\\nPosition Q1  2020 Q4  2019 Q3  2019 Q2 2019 Q1  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeverage Ratio 11.46% 10.88% 10.89% 10.59% 12.00% \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 Ratio 20.54% 19.66% 18.73% 17.99% 20.02% \\r\\n\\r\\nT1 Capital Ratio 20.54% 19.66%   18.73% 17.99% 20.02% \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Capital Ratio 20.54% 19.66% 18.73% 17.99% 20.02% \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n1.1%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.0%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.9% 1.2%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.3% 0.4%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.1%0.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.4%\\r\\n\\r\\nBaltic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOther EU Non-EU \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 19  \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the prudential requirements, the Pillar 2 requirement set by the ECB in the 2019 Joint Decision on Capital and the \\r\\nSystemic risk and Countercyclical risk buffer requirements set by the Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian regulators, Luminor Group is \\r\\nrequired to hold capital exceeding 10.8% CET1 and 15.2% Total capital.

capital. The bonus share issue is \\r\\nbased on the bank’s interim balance sheet as of January 2, 2019 and involves a partial conversion of share premium in the amount of 216 030 920 EUR \\r\\ninto share capital. Following the bonus issue, the share capital of the bank has been reduced by the same amount and was paid out to the shareholders \\r\\nin September 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 25  \\r\\n\\r\\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Notes Q1 2020 Q1 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flows from operating activities       \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit before tax   -18 965 28 010 \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustment for:       \\r\\n\\r\\n-Net impairment (losses)/ reversal on loans to customers  11 26 411 -7 276 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Dividend income   -18 -29 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Share of profit from an associate   -311 -214 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Loss/(profit) from foreign currency revaluation   124 235 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Depreciation, amortisation and impairment   2 990 3 571 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Other adjustments   1 674 -301 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Interest income  4 -70 624 -74 550 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Interest expenses  4 16 544 10 736 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from operations before changes in operating assets/liabilities   -42 175 -39 818 \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in operating assets/liabilities       \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of lending to customers   269 868 211 118 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of other assets   -4 740 5 736 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (+) / decrease (-) of client deposits   -984 064 -1 221 607 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of liabilities   12 211 8 904 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest received   69 543 65 233 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest paid   -16 971 -18 981 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncome tax paid   -2 840 -1 394 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from operating activites   -656 993 -950 991 \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nInvesting activities       \\r\\n\\r\\nAcquisition of property and equipment and intangible assets   -979 -2 632 \\r\\n\\r\\nAcquisition of investment property  0 800 \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from disposal of property and equipment and intangible assets  625 8 401 \\r\\n\\r\\nDividend received   18 29 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from investing activities   -336 6 598 \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancing activities       \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued   503 313 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments of principal on leases   -670 -811 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flows from financing activities   502 643 -811 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 26  \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents   -196 861 -985 022 \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period  8,9 2 952 815 3 310 517 \\r\\n\\r\\nEffects of currency translation on cash and cash equivalents   -124 -235 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents   -196 861 -985 022 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period   2 755 830 2 325 260 \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents comprises       \\r\\n\\r\\nCash on hand  8 135 955 171 779 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-restricted  current account  with central bank  8 2 510 860 2 005 235 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions on demand or with original maturity of three months or \\r\\nless \\r\\n\\r\\n 9 109 015 148 246 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   2 755 830 2 325 260 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 27  \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL \\r\\nSTATEMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\n1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE INFORMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) is a local credit institution whose parent company is Luminor Holding AS that is \\r\\nultimately controlled by BCP VII, an investment fund managed by an affiliate of Blackstone Group Inc. Other shareholders of Luminor \\r\\nHolding AS - Nordea Bank Abp and DNB BANK ASA - are considered to be the entities with significant influence over the Group. The \\r\\nLuminor Bank’s registered legal address is Liivalaia 45, 10145, Tallinn, Republic of Estonia. \\r\\n\\r\\nNew company Luminor Holding AS, established on the 14th of May 2019, is the new parent company of Luminor Bank AS since 23 \\r\\nSeptember 2019. Until 23 September 2019 the parent company was Luminor Group AB. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor Bank AS has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries through \\r\\nthe Estonian registered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone acquired a 60.1% majority stake in the Luminor \\r\\nHolding AS, the owner of Luminor Bank AS. Luminor Bank AS previous owners, Nordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB BANK ASA \\r\\n(\"DNB\"), each retained a 19.95% equity stake in the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current interim report, “Bank” (or Luminor Bank AS) refers to Luminor Bank AS. “Group” refers to the consolidated financial \\r\\nstatements of Luminor Bank AS and its subsidiaries.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 March 2020 Luminor Bank AS directly or indirectly owned majority in the following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\nRepublic of Estonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country  \\r\\nRepublic of Latvia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\nRepublic of Lithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Liising AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Pensions Estonia AS \\r\\n\\r\\n• Promano Estonia OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Asset Management IPAS \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Finance SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Līzings SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Realm SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Salvus SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Salvus 2 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Salvus 3 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Salvus 4 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Salvus 6 SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Trioleta SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Baltic ipasums SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n• Industrius UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n• Intractus UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n• Promano Lit UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n• Recurso UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Investiciju \\r\\nValdymas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Lizingas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n• Gėlužės projektai UAB \\r\\n(under liquidation) \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 March 2020 Luminor Bank AS had ownership in the following associated companies (25%): \\r\\n\\r\\n• ALD Automotive AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n• ALD Automotive SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n• ALD Automotive UAB  \\r\\n\\r\\n• SIA Kredītinformācijas Birojs \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 28  \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) was prepared in \\r\\naccordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed consolidated interim financial \\r\\ninformation does not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in \\r\\nconjunction with the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are consistent with \\r\\nthose followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, except \\r\\nfor the adoption of new standards effective as of 1 January 2020. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or \\r\\namendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. Several amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2020, but \\r\\ndo not have a material impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.   \\r\\n\\r\\nGroup decided to present financial information in interim report at the same format as  it was presented in  the annual financial \\r\\nstatements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019, therefore  comparative data for the period Q1 2019 has been \\r\\nupdated accordingly. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and applies assumptions that affect the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements and \\r\\nthe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s \\r\\nexperience and expectations of future events. In the first quarter of the 2020 global COVID-19 pandemic affected many economies, \\r\\nindividuals and companies and thus also required Luminor to react and make certain judgements which inter alia had the effect on the \\r\\nimpairment amounts. \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognizes credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The Standard applies a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) \\r\\napproach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at \\r\\nfair value through profit or loss (FVPL), together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The assets to test for \\r\\nimpairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes assets where there has been \\r\\nno significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or which are classified as low credit risk (credit rating indicating investment \\r\\ngrade). The allowances for stage 1 assets are based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default in the next \\r\\ntwelve months (12-month expected credit loss). Stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk. The \\r\\nallowances for stage 2 assets are based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default over the life of the asset \\r\\n(lifetime expected credit losses). Stage 3 includes credit-impaired (defaulted) assets, and the allowances reflect the lifetime expected \\r\\ncredit losses. Material assets in stage 3 are tested for impairment on an individual basis, while for immaterial stage 3 assets a collective \\r\\nassessment is performed. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for additional category - \\r\\npurchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) - regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable \\r\\ninputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include: \\r\\n\\r\\n• evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2; identification \\r\\nof unlikely to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3; \\r\\n\\r\\n• classification of forbearance and Watch list; \\r\\n\\r\\n• assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including the \\r\\nvarious formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\r\\n• the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and \\r\\nexposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\r\\n• determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic and \\r\\npessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 29  \\r\\n\\r\\n• estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and assigning \\r\\nprobabilities to those scenarios; \\r\\n\\r\\n• setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe model applied (including triggers for significant increase in credit risk) was not changed in the first quarter of 2020. The \\r\\nmacroeconomic parameters were reviewed to reflect the outlook due to COVID-19.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMore qualitative and quantitative information on an impairment of financial assets in light of COVID-19 is provided in Note 3 General \\r\\nRisk Management Policies. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from \\r\\nactive markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The input to \\r\\nthese models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in \\r\\nestablishing fair values. For the fair value of financial assets and liabilities refer to Note 17. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nMAIN GOALS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of risk management at Luminor is to achieve an optimal balance between the risk of losses and the earnings potential in a \\r\\nmedium- and long-term perspective.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor Risk Management function is organised in order to ensure efficient and effective risk management and full implementation \\r\\nof the principles and requirements outlined in Luminor’s Risk Policy and Strategy.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk management principles are the following: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Risk Accountability: every area in the Group is accountable for the risks arising from their activities; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Risk Identification, Assessment, Measurement, Monitoring, Mitigation and Reporting: all material exposures must be identified, \\r\\nassessed, managed and reported in a timely and accurate manner; \\r\\n\\r\\n• The Group shall have a conservative overall risk profile and only assume risk which Luminor is able to identify, assess, manage \\r\\nand monitor; \\r\\n\\r\\n• The Group is committed not to offer products or services or perform other acts which entail a risk of contributing to unethical \\r\\nconduct, infringement of human or labour rights, corruption or serious environmental harm. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group maintains a Recovery Plan following the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive adopted by the European Parliament. The \\r\\nplan serves as one of Luminor’s key risk management tools and ensures procedures for restoration of the Group’s solvency following \\r\\nsituations of severe stress without any involvement by or support from the authorities or taxpayers. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s risk appetite in general is low. The Group assesses its capital and liquidity adequacy on an ongoing basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group analyses, evaluates, accepts and manages the risks or combinations of risks to which it is exposed to. The most important \\r\\ntypes of risk the Group is exposed to are solvency risk, credit risk, model risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, reputational \\r\\nrisk, and  business model risk. Concentration risk is assessed as part of the credit risk, other types of concentration risk are assessed to \\r\\nbe less material for the Group. Market risk includes foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. Operational risk includes also \\r\\ncompliance, fraud and financial crime, business continuity and IT stability risks, as well as risks related to cyber- and information \\r\\nsecurity.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the light of COVID-19 epidemic developments in Europe, the ECB-led Comprehensive Assessment (i.e. both the Asset Quality Review \\r\\nand Stress Test exercises) has been put on hold until further notice. The ECB will inform Luminor when the new information on revised \\r\\ndates and timelines is available. Luminor has reprioritized its strategic activities for year 2020 accordingly and is focusing on a COVID-\\r\\n19 impact assessment and performs institution-wide stress tests under COVID-19 affected macroeconomic scenarios and financial \\r\\nshocks. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 30  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk management in the Group is organised in such a way that any possible conflicts of interest are avoided or escalated. \\r\\n\\r\\nOrganisational Structure of the Risk Management function: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Enterprise Risk Department is a centralized center of expertise and manages risk management tools and processes which run across \\r\\ndifferent risk types. The control function for operational risk lies under the responsibility of the Operational Risk Department. The \\r\\nMarket & Liquidity Risk  Department is responsible for market risk and liquidity risk control. The control function for credit risk is split \\r\\nunder the responsibility of the Credit Risk Department and Credit Risk Quantification Department. The Model Risk & Validation \\r\\nDepartment owns the model risk framework and respective validation activities. The Risk Programmes: CA & IRB Department and Risk \\r\\nTransformation Department drive Luminor’s development and further improvement of risk management. The Risk division is part of \\r\\nthe second line of defence and the organisational departments within the Risk division report directly to the Group Chief Risk Officer \\r\\n(CRO).  \\r\\n\\r\\nRisk management processes and the effectiveness of internal control are assessed by the Internal Audit function (third line of defence). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe internal control framework – as a system of organisational measures, actions covering the whole Luminor Group, including the \\r\\nManagement’s responsibilities and tasks, and the activities of all business lines and internal units, including internal control functions, \\r\\noutsourced activities and distribution channels and internal procedures – ensures the effective and efficient operations and prudent \\r\\nconduct of business, compliance with laws, regulations, supervisory requirements and Luminor’s internal policies, the adequate and \\r\\ncontinuous identification, assessment, measurement, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of risks, the sound administrative and \\r\\naccounting procedures as well as the reliability of financial and non-financial information and submission thereof in a timely manner. \\r\\nThe Management Board is responsible for establishing and monitoring the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control system and \\r\\nfor overseeing all business lines and internal units in the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Management Board and/or Supervisory Council approve the most important policies and strategies comprising the Group’s risk \\r\\nmanagement framework.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supervisory Council Risk Committee advises the Supervisory Council regarding the setting and monitoring of risk appetite, strategy \\r\\nand further matters related to risk management. The Supervisory Council Risk Committee raises concerns and warns, where \\r\\nappropriate, when specific developments materially affect or may affect Luminor’s risk profile.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Credit Committee is a decision-making body regarding individual credit cases and contributes to the development of a sound and \\r\\nuniform credit culture in the Group. The Credit Committee provides recommendations regarding important credit regulations. \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures imposed by most of the European countries had an adverse impact on economies \\r\\nin the first quarter of 2020. Luminor has been monitoring the spread of COVID-19 since early 2020 and was preparing to adjust its risk \\r\\nmanagement to the new reality. The impact on different types of risks is disclosed further below. \\r\\n\\r\\nCREDIT RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit risk is defined as the risk for the Group to incur losses due to customers’ failure to fulfil their financial obligations towards the \\r\\nGroup. Credit exposures arise primarily in lending activities, including from off-balance sheet financial instruments, such as loan \\r\\ncommitments, guarantees and letters of credit. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe key principles of Luminor’s credit risk management are outlined in the Group Credit Policy, Credit Strategy for Legal Entities and \\r\\nCredit Strategy for Private Individuals. Practical aspects of the application of the principles set out in these documents, and decision-\\r\\nmaking processes are regulated by the Credit Manual for Legal Entities and Credit Manual for Private Individuals. \\r\\n\\r\\nGroup Chief Risk \\r\\nOfficer\\r\\n\\r\\nEnterprise Risk\\r\\nOperational \\r\\n\\r\\nRisk\\r\\nMarket & \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity Risk\\r\\nCredit Risk\\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Risk \\r\\nQuantification\\r\\n\\r\\nModel Risk & \\r\\nInternal \\r\\n\\r\\nValidation\\r\\n\\r\\nRisk \\r\\nProgrammes: \\r\\n\\r\\nCA & IRB\\r\\n\\r\\nRisk \\r\\nTransformation\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 31  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe spread of the COVID-19 is a global tragedy that requires governments, private businesses, and all citizens to work together and \\r\\nfight this disease and its consequences. In a first instance, this has required governments across Europe and also in the Baltic states to \\r\\nimpose significant constraints on social- and economic life to slow the spread of the disease, avoid overburdening of the health care \\r\\nsystem, and by doing so saving lives. These social- and economic constraints carry high costs, because they imply a significant reduction \\r\\nof economic activity, including businesses being almost entirely shut down in certain sectors, and strongly increasing unemployment \\r\\nas a consequence. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince Luminor is one of the largest banks in the Baltic region, many of Luminor’s customers are directly or indirectly affected by this \\r\\nsituation, some of our customers are severely affected. We in Luminor feel therefore strongly that we need to play as constructive role \\r\\nas possible to support our customers during this time of need and to serve the Baltic states and communities by securing a robust and \\r\\nstable financial system and robust and stable financial services. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis also requires from Luminor to extend additional support and additional solutions to our customers in order to make sure that our \\r\\ncustomers get through this difficult period as well as possible. On the other hand, Luminor is also charged with the responsibility to \\r\\nprotect Luminor’s depositors, and to make sure that Luminor’s balance sheet and the Baltic financial system do not become \\r\\noverburdened by businesses for which there is no outlook of recovering from this crisis into a sound and viable business. These \\r\\ncustomers need to be significantly restructured, and in cases where even that is no longer feasible, some businesses might have to be \\r\\nwound down in an orderly manner. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to be able to appropriately work with customers and manage COVID-19 related credit risks, the Group prepared a dedicated \\r\\n“COVID-19 Manual” for Legal Entities. Luminor’s general focus on our customers’ ability and willingness to perform their financial \\r\\nobligations is maintained. When considering modifications, particular emphasis is put on whether deteriorations are triggered by the \\r\\nexternal COVID-19 shock and a robust recovery is expected afterwards. Luminor’s standard approach and procedures are applied if \\r\\ndeteriorations started already before COVID-19 or deteriorations are not related to COVID-19. The industry in which the customer \\r\\noperates, the fact whether Luminor is the main lender, and the type of credit product also play a role. In case of new lending, the \\r\\nfinancial ability to serve the credit remains a key aspect. For individual customers payment holidays on principal payments for a limited \\r\\nperiod of time might be granted either automatically if certain predefined conditions are met or through performing individual \\r\\nassessments. By the end of first quarter 2020 no industry-wide private moratoria which would comply with the European Banking \\r\\nAuthority’s (the EBA) Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria on loan repayments applied in the light of the COVID-19 \\r\\ncrisis were in place. \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit decisions are made by Credit Committees and authorised individuals according to defined powers to act, which are risk adjusted. \\r\\nThe decision of the Credit Committee must be unanimous. Powers to act for individuals (Credit Officers and persons from Sales, \\r\\nRestructuring & Recovery) are personal and based on competence level. Some extent of flexibility for decision taking on “automatic” \\r\\nchanges was introduced to be able to handle more customer requests for modifications. \\r\\n\\r\\nModifications and forbearances \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has defined standard modification solutions for COVID-19 affected customers. For individual customers standard/automatic \\r\\ngrace period for principal payments is granted if the customer had acceptable payment history (no more than 21 days overdue during \\r\\nlast 12 months): up to 6 months for mortgage loans, up to 3 months for consumer loans and leasing agreements. For business customers \\r\\nsolutions are also product specific. For commercial loans, a grace period up to 6 months is granted for low and medium risk level \\r\\ncustomers. For leasing agreements, a grace period up to 3 months is possible, if the leasing object is a passenger car and historical \\r\\noverdues during the last 12 months did not exceed 15 days; and for low and medium risk transportation sector entities where exposure \\r\\ndoes not exceed 2 million EUR and historical overdues and trends in historical financial results evidence that difficulties are purely \\r\\nCOVID-19 related. \\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual evaluation of modification requests is performed for all other cases. For COVID-19 affected customers the state support \\r\\nprogrammes or state guarantees are used whenever feasible. \\r\\n\\r\\nForbearance treatment in essence is kept unchanged, the integral condition is financial difficulties. Currently the modification is not \\r\\nclassified as forbearance if  \\r\\n\\r\\n• individual customers have good payment history and acceptable loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, meaning overdues below 21 days \\r\\nduring last 12 months and LTV below 85 per cent; \\r\\n\\r\\n• business customers are considered low and medium risk, taking into account the combination of financial risk and industry risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nBesides regular reports prepared and presented to the Group’s management bodies to follow the level and developments of the \\r\\nassumed credit risk, specific COVID-19 related reports are being prepared which are also shared with the ECB. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 32  \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment policies \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognises credit losses in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. IFRS applies a forward-looking expected credit loss \\r\\n(ECL) approach. For more detailed information on the impairment policies, please refer to Note 5 General Risk Management Policies of \\r\\nthe Luminor Bank AS Annual Report 2019. In the first quarter of 2020 the impairment methodology remained unchanged. \\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent authorities – the ECB, EBA, European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), IFRS Foundation, Basel Committee on Banking \\r\\nSupervision (BCBS) – have announced various measures to deal with the crisis and minimise the effect on the economies. The Group \\r\\nacts in line with above mentioned institutions’ guidance in regards of ECL. The modifications granted for COVID-19 affected customers \\r\\ndo not automatically indicate Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR), nor classification to forbearance or default status. However, the \\r\\nobligation to assess for unlikeliness to pay (which consequently triggers default status) remains in place. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe set of SICR triggers was not changed: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Significant increase of lifetime PD – significant increase of lifetime PD since initial recognition until the reporting date (2.5 times \\r\\nand 0.6 p.p. jointly); \\r\\n\\r\\n• Risk grade 9 or 10 – risk grade 9 or 10 as at the reporting date; \\r\\n\\r\\n• >30 days past due – more than 30 days past due as at the reporting date; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Forborne performing – forborne performing status as at the reporting date (forbearance not triggering non-performing status) \\r\\nin accordance with FINREP instruction reporting requirements; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Watch list – watch list status as at the reporting date. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nIf at least one of the above SICR indicators is identified after initial recognition of the financial instrument and was not present as of its \\r\\norigination the financial asset is treated as facing a significant increase in credit risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nThree macroeconomic variables - annual change in real GDP, unemployment rate and annual change of residential real estate price - \\r\\nare included in the PD and LGD estimation modelling for the individual customers segment and two of them – annual change in real \\r\\nGDP together with unemployment rate – are used for PD and LGD estimation modelling in case of the business customers segment. \\r\\nThe following tables show the parameters that were used for macroeconomic modelling as at 31 March 2020 and 31 December 2019. \\r\\nFor the first quarter of 2020 the forecasts of macroeconomic variables were updated by Luminor macroeconomists at the end of March \\r\\n2020 with projections and assumptions over three years. Following the ECB guidance, excessively procyclical forecasts were avoided \\r\\nassuming not only the nearest short-term downturn (the first year) but also the recovery period in the market after that (the second \\r\\nand the third year). Starting from the fourth year it is assumed that risk parameters (PD and LGD) converge to their long-term average \\r\\nlevels (estimated over the cycle). \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 33  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic variables Optimistic scenario Baseline scenario (realistic) Pessimistic scenario \\r\\n\\r\\n Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for scenario, % 30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real GDP, % 3.2 4.5 4.7 -3.3 3.1 2.8 -3.6 -1.1 2.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, % 6.1 5.9 4.8 7.1 7.7 6.2 11.0 10.7 10.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of residential real \\r\\n\\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n7.4 8.4 6.8 -5.2 6.3 7.1 -16.5 -8.6 1.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvia \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic variables Optimistic scenario Baseline scenario (realistic) Pessimistic scenario \\r\\n\\r\\n Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for scenario, % 30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real GDP, % 1.5 5.3 3.6 -1.8 5.5 2.5 -5.6 1.7 1.6 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, % 8.5 6.8 5.0 9.3 8.0 6.4 12.4 11.7 10.1 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of residential real \\r\\n\\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n3.0 5.0 8.0 -4.0 3.0 6.0 -12.0 -7.0 1.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nLithuania \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic variables Optimistic scenario Baseline scenario (realistic) Pessimistic scenario \\r\\n\\r\\n Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Q1 2023 \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for scenario, % 30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real GDP, % 1.6 4.5 4.0 -1.9 5.0 3.2 -4.3 1.0 2.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, % 7.8 5.6 4.8 8.5 7.0 6.0 11.8 10.7 9.9 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of residential real \\r\\n\\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n4.0 8.0 6.5 -4.0 8.0 5.0 -19.0 -5.0 2.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 34  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic variables Optimistic scenario Baseline scenario (realistic) Pessimistic scenario \\r\\n\\r\\n Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for scenario, % 30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real GDP, % 4.2 3.5 3.2 2.7 2.3 2.1 -3.1 -1.1 2.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, % 5.0 4.9 4.8 5.7 6.1 6.2 11.0 10.7 10.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of residential real \\r\\n\\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n9.0 7.2 5.8 4.1 3.2 3.1 -16.5 -8.6 1.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvia \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic variables Optimistic scenario Baseline scenario (realistic) Pessimistic scenario \\r\\n\\r\\n Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for scenario, % 30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real GDP, % 3.4 4.1 4.7 1.9 3.0 4.2 -3.0 -0.6 3.2 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, % 5.7 5.2 4.7 6.2 5.9 5.4 9.4 10.3 9.6 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of residential real \\r\\n\\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n7.0 8.0 8.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 -7.0 -4.0 -1.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nLithuania \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic variables Optimistic scenario Baseline scenario (realistic) Pessimistic scenario \\r\\n\\r\\n Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 Q3 2020 Q3 2021 Q3 2022 \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for scenario, % 30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real GDP, % 4.2 3.8 4.0 2.8 2.4 2.5 -2.0 -1.6 1.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, % 6.2 5.8 5.5 6.5 6.7 6.8 8.8 10.2 9.5 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of residential real \\r\\n\\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n9.0 6.0 6.0 5 3 3 -8.0 -2.0 4.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAsset quality \\r\\n\\r\\nThe adverse impact of COVID-19 is reflected in asset quality of Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most severe consequences will most probably be seen in industries like accommodation, tourism, and aviation. Even though \\r\\nLuminor’s portfolio towards these economic sectors is relatively small, negative trends in the portfolio are still observed since many \\r\\nother industries are quite severely affected as well. As a result, requests for modifications (including grace period) reached 0.9 billion \\r\\nEUR at the end of March 2020 and exceeded 1.1 billion EUR (11% of the total credit portfolio) by the middle of April 2020.  \\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering the situation, and the generous terms for modifications, the number of modifications has been limited so far.  \\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 70% of modification requests came from business customers. Earlier applications for modification from business \\r\\ncustomers compared to individual customers can be explained by the following reasons: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 35  \\r\\n\\r\\n• business customers have been affected first; moreover, professional financial management leads business customers to \\r\\n\\r\\nimmediately approach the bank, if foreseeing the need for modifications;  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n• individual customers often have unemployment benefits. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest part of modification requests from business customers are for industries like real estate activities, transportation and \\r\\nstorage, wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common modification type is grace period on principal payments. Luminor is restrictive (applying only exceptionally) towards \\r\\ngranting full grace period (including grace on interest payments). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe volume of overdue loans is fluctuating and not yet showing negative trends, however, depending on the development of the \\r\\npandemic and measures taken by governments, this might accelerate in the second quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal exposure and respective allowances distribution by Stages is provided further below in this note. \\r\\n\\r\\nMaximum exposure to credit risk before collateral held or other credit enhancements \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is reflected in the carrying amounts of financial assets in the consolidated statement of \\r\\nfinancial position.

Approximately 60% of total impairments during the first quarter of 2020 were made for individually assessed \\r\\nStage 3 exposures, of which 30% are related to the largest non-performing customer and oil price shock, 60% are for new non-\\r\\nperforming customers and 10% are due to reviewed assumptions for existing non-performing customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe remainder of the change in allowances for impairment is explained by the change of macroeconomic scenarios for Stage 1 and \\r\\nStage 2 impairment, Stage 2 portfolio increase and due to higher observed default frequencies compared to modelled PDs. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 38  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal

institutions mainly comprise nostro and custody cash account balances with Luminor \\r\\ncorrespondent banks.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAll banks are risk classified and risk limits are established. In case the external rating for a bank is not available a conservative expert \\r\\njudgment serves as basis for the Group internal rating, which reflects the bank’s credit strength, derived from macroeconomic factors \\r\\nand bank’s own solvency and liquidity factors, together with qualitative non-financial adjustments. The internal risk grade and \\r\\nprobability of default (PD) of banks is based on the available risk classifications from rating agencies Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and \\r\\nFitch.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Luminor a separate dedicated Financial Institutions unit acts as a single core competence center and ensures holistic overview of the \\r\\nGroup’s credit limits/exposure on banks and countries. Since March 2020, the Financial Institutions unit has switched from quarterly \\r\\nto daily portfolio monitoring. A Financial Institutions Credit Commitee is organised on a regular basis to follow-up the latest market \\r\\ndevelopments and review if any changes/restrictions are needed for established credit limits towards banks and countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\n The Group’s portfolio consists of reputable investment grade correspondent banks that have not experienced credit rating downgrades \\r\\nduring the first quarter of 2020 and from COVID-19, except one counterpart bank that has been downgraded by one notch, but is still \\r\\non BBB level. \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities exposure of the Group at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was 258.5 million EUR compared to 223.8 million EUR at \\r\\nthe end of 2019. The credit risk arising from these securities is evaluated with a separate metric, but overall exposure is limited, as most \\r\\nof these debt securities are issued by the governments of Lithuania and Latvia. The remaining part consists of international bonds \\r\\nguaranteed by France, Belgium and Luxembourg governments, Austria sovereign bonds, which are all treated as level 1 assets in the \\r\\nLCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) calculation, and a minor position of Lithuanian corporate bonds. The average weighted duration of the \\r\\ntotal portfolio is 3 years compared to 3.1 at the end of 2019. Debt securities investments are performed in accordance with the limits \\r\\nset by Luminor’s Management Board and the Supervisory Council. Limit utilization is monitored on daily basis. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 58  \\r\\n\\r\\nMARKET RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has a low risk appetite for market risk, which is defined as the risk of losses in on- and off-balance sheet positions arising \\r\\nfrom adverse movements in market parameters such as interest rates (interest rate risk), credit spreads (credit spread risk), currency \\r\\nexchange rates (foreign exchange or FX risk), equity prices (equity price risk) or commodity prices (commodity price risk). The most \\r\\nsignificant parts of the market risk for the Group are interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange risk, while the significance \\r\\nof other risks is lower.  \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate risk is assessed using the basis-point-value (BPV) method, which measures the impact on the value of net cash flows from \\r\\na one basis point (0.01%) parallel shift in market interest rates. The BPV calculations are performed on a regular basis and submitted \\r\\nto the Group’s Management.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit spread risk is evaluated analysing the bank’s consolidated bond portfolio, including liquidity bond portfolio managed by Treasury \\r\\nand Asset and Liability Management Department, trading bond portfolio managed by Markets Department’s Fixed Income desk and \\r\\ndebt securities owned by separate entities within the Group if any. Changes in the credit spreads for debt instruments are estimated \\r\\nevaluating bond credit rating, asset liquidity, interest rates, default history if any.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrency risk (foreign exchange or FX risk) is evaluated calculating open foreign exchange positions on Group level.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll the above risks are limited by the Risk Appetite Framework and/or lower level limits monitored on a regular basis. Additionally, \\r\\nderivative transactions from operations of Markets Department can only be performed on back-to-back basis. Therefore, the Group’s \\r\\noverall exposure towards market risk remains low. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to the spread of the novel corona virus COVID-19, the major negative impact to the Group in terms of market risk could \\r\\narise from credit spread risk. This risk is mitigated by limits as well as certain quality requirements for the bond portfolios. The potential \\r\\nimpact of the credit spread risk is disclosed in the corresponding section below considering stress assumptions. \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket risk measurement approaches \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is mainly focused on the management of interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange risk, which are, as outlined \\r\\nabove, the most significant risks.   \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate risk is assessed as the impact of a yield curve parallel shift on the present value of the gap between total assets and total \\r\\nliabilities. In general, assets have longer maturities than liabilities, which creates risks due to open interest rate positions. Therefore, \\r\\ninterbank funding is attracted to decrease the discrepancy between long and short terms. In addition to this, interest rate swaps are \\r\\nused to achieve and maintain an acceptable level of interest rate risk on total level, on currency level and within individual time bands. \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit spread risk for the Group arises from debt securities in the liquidity bond portfolio (sovereign and covered bonds) and exposures \\r\\nin the trading debt portfolio mostly consisting of sovereign and corporate debt. The Group measures the stressed spread impact to its \\r\\nliquidity bond portfolio only due to materiality, assuming a 100 basis points spread widening towards risk-free alternative investments \\r\\nof matching maturity profile for A-rated bonds and a 50 basis points spread widening for corresponding AA-rated bonds. \\r\\n\\r\\nFX risk is assessed as an open position between assets and liabilities for a respective currency. Open positions for all currencies in the \\r\\nGroup are restricted by the limits set by the Luminor’s Management Board and the Supervisory Council, and monitored on a daily basis.  \\r\\n\\r\\nINTEREST RATE RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main source of interest rate risk in the Group is the repricing risk – risk related to the timing mismatch in the maturity and repricing \\r\\nof assets and liabilities of on- and off-balance sheet positions. Pursuant to Luminor’s Market Risk Policy, interest rate risk is limited in \\r\\nterms of basis point value (BPV), i.e. the change in net cash flows (gaps) given a one basis point (0.01%) parallel shift in the market \\r\\ninterest rates. Separate limits for banking and trading activities are approved by the Management Board and the Supervisory Council \\r\\nof Luminor Bank AS, as well as limits for different currencies: EUR, USD, NOK and sum of all other currencies. When calculating the total \\r\\nexposure the sums of BPV in each currency are aggregated irrespective if the total exposure in each individual currency is a short or \\r\\nlong position, i.e. netting of positions between currencies is not allowed. The main part of the interest rate risk arises from the positions \\r\\nthat are denominated in EUR. Using derivatives as hedges is a major part of interest risk management, please also refer to Note 10. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk from changes in interest rates increases for longer duration time buckets due to higher uncertainty of future rates. To limit risk \\r\\nexposure resulting from different time buckets, so-called gapping limits are determined for each of them. Limit established for each \\r\\ntime bucket is defined as a percentage of the total BPV limit allocated to the relevant currency. All time buckets till one year period are \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 59  \\r\\n\\r\\nlimited to 100% of total BPV, 1-2 years gap is limited to 120% of total BPV, and all time buckets above 2 years are limited to 150% of \\r\\ntotal BPV. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s BPV exposure by currencies for both trading and banking activities (thousand EUR):  \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrency 31 March 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nEUR -25 299 -41 291 \\r\\n\\r\\nUSD 3 587 4 965 \\r\\n\\r\\nNOK 331 727 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther currencies -340 -65 \\r\\n\\r\\nSensitivity to interest rate risk \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate risk exposure cannot exceed BPV limits approved by the Luminor’s Management Board and the Supervisory Council. \\r\\nAssuming a 200 basis points parallel shift of the yield curve, sensitivity of interest rate risk shall be calculated multiplying total BPV \\r\\nexposure by interest rate change. The above mentioned shift of the yield curve creates the following impact on the Group’s equity and \\r\\nprofit/loss (thousand EUR):  \\r\\n\\r\\n 31 March 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity 3 191 9 410 \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit/Loss 16 636 14 029 \\r\\n\\r\\nCREDIT SPREAD RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bank follows a rigorous framework for debt securities management. Bond portfolios managed by Treasury and Asset and Liability \\r\\nManagement and Markets Departments are restricted in size, level of quality, region available and counterparty, limiting credit risk \\r\\nexposure. However, the bank measures the stressed spread impact to its liquidity bond portfolio as part of the Risk Appetite Framework. \\r\\nAssuming a 100 basis points spread widening towards risk-free alternative investments of matching maturity profile for A-rated bonds \\r\\nand a 50 basis points spread widening for corresponding AA-rated bonds, the projected decrease in market value of the bonds would \\r\\nbe the following: \\r\\n\\r\\n 31 March 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket value loss projection due to increase in credit spreads 6.5 6.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE (FX) RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s main exposure is towards euro currency (EUR), while positions of other currencies are not significant. A conservative \\r\\napproach to FX risk is followed within the Group. It is measured as the nominal value of the open FX positions converted to EUR using \\r\\nthe ECB rates. The Group has both intraday and overnight limits. Some technical deviations from the limits are allowed only for a short \\r\\nterm when servicing customers. The Group has approved separate limits for the United States Dollar (USD), sum of other currencies, \\r\\nmax of other currencies and total currencies. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 60  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s exposure to FX risk (thousand EUR): \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrency 31 March 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nUSD 77 97 \\r\\n\\r\\nMax of other currencies* 97 302 \\r\\n\\r\\nSum of other currencies** 318 609 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal*** 307 383 \\r\\n\\r\\n*Max of other currencies – this represents the maximum absolute exposure of all foreign currencies other than USD. \\r\\n**Sum of other currencies – this represents the sum of all foreign currency exposures in absolute terms excluding USD. \\r\\n***Total – this represents the higher absolute value between sum of positive exposures and sum of negative exposures of all foreign currency open \\r\\npositions. \\r\\n\\r\\nSensitivity of foreign exchange risk \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bank applies value-at-risk (VaR) model for simulation of volatility parameters which are then applied to the actual open foreign \\r\\nexchange positions to evaluate loss projection. VaR model is set considering the 99 percent confidence level, assuming 10-day holding \\r\\nperiod and calibrated from at least 5-year long time series, including periods of market turbulence. Risk parameters for currencies other \\r\\nthan USD are increased by 50%. \\r\\n\\r\\nFX stress test under the above mentioned conditions indicates a possible loss of EUR 30 thousands as of the first quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nEQUITY AND COMMODITY RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group does not have any open position in commodity instruments, thus is not exposed to commodity price risk.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group does not have any open positions in equity instruments held for trading. However, the Group owns some shares on its \\r\\nbalance sheet which are recognized as participation in the settlement systems rather than any kind of investment in shares. The total \\r\\nvalue of these shares has increased over the year 2019 due to a positive trend of underlying instruments, thus, in accordance to external \\r\\naudit recommendations, equity instruments have been reclassified as debt securities at fair value through profit/loss. In terms of stress \\r\\ntest, a value-at-risk (VaR) model has been used with a 99% confidence level and 1 year holding period, whereas the horizon of data \\r\\nanalyzed includes the latest financial crisis in 2008-2009 and consists of at least 5 years of historical developments of share prices. The \\r\\nresulting shock applied to the total value of shares produced an outcome of possible loss equal to 2.1 million EUR as at the end of the \\r\\nfirst quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations in time, the risk of incurring losses due to \\r\\nthe sudden decrease in financial resources (e.g. a financial crisis situation may result in a delay of incoming payments) or an increase \\r\\nof the price of new resources for refinancing. The consequence of liquidity risk may be failure to meet obligations to repay depositors \\r\\nand fulfil loan commitments. The Group uses a range of liquidity metrics for measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk \\r\\nincluding the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) and internal liquidity limits. \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed to ensure a constant ability to settle contractual obligations. The Group has developed a set of early warning \\r\\nindicators for a timely identification of liquidity crises, and business and funding contingency funding plans to manage the Group’s \\r\\nliquidity during market disruptions. The liquidity risk management strategy is reviewed at least annually or after any significant change \\r\\nin the internal or external environment the Group operates in. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 61  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed across the three Lines of Defence: \\r\\n\\r\\n• The First Line of Defence comprises the Group’s Treasury and Asset and Liability Management (TALM) and the business areas. \\r\\nTALM is responsible for the daily liquidity management and funds transfer pricing (FTP). To ensure the funding in situations where \\r\\nLuminor is in urgent need of cash and the normal funding sources do not suffice, Luminor holds a liquidity buffer that consists of \\r\\ncentral bank cash and high quality securities that can be readily sold or used as collateral in funding operations;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Market and Liquidity Risk Department is the Second Line of Defence and is responsible for providing independent oversight and \\r\\ncontrol of liquidity risk and the First Line of Defence; \\r\\n\\r\\n• The Internal Audit function is the Third Line of Defence, which is responsible for providing independent assurance over the First \\r\\nand Second Lines of Defence activities. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk management is divided into long-term (1 year), short-term (1 week to 3 months) risk management and intraday liquidity \\r\\nmanagement. The aim of short-term liquidity management is to meet the daily need for funds to ensure compliance with the reserve \\r\\nand liquidity requirements set by the ECB, as well as compliance with internal liquidity limits. Short-term liquidity is maintained through \\r\\nthe daily monitoring of the liquidity status and day-to-day funding and trading the appropriate financial instruments for liquidity \\r\\npurposes. Long-term liquidity risk management is supported by analysing the estimated future cash flows taking into account deposit \\r\\nand loan portfolio growth, as well as possible refinancing sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of the liquidity risk assessment, the liquidity gap is analysed considering the maturity of cash flows. The liquidity risk is \\r\\nrestricted by imposing internal limits on the liquidity gap. Utilisation of this limit is subject to regular monitoring and reporting to \\r\\nmanagement bodies in the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity gap is calculated by analysing the Group’s net refinancing situation within one week, one month and three months applying \\r\\na \"business as usual\" approach. Liquid assets and short-term liabilities are included in liquidity gap calculation for respective terms (1 \\r\\nweek to 3 months). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Liquidity Coverage Ratio is calculated as the ratio of a credit institution’s liquidity buffer to its net liquidity outflows over a 30-\\r\\ncalendar-day stress period and is expressed as a percentage. The minimum regulatory limit of LCR is set at 100%, however the Group \\r\\nhas a substantial buffer and maintains a higher ratio. The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of the Group’s liquidity \\r\\nrisk profile and requires the holding of risk-free assets that may be easily liquidated to meet required payments for outflows net of \\r\\ninflows during a thirty-day crisis period without support from the central bank. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the

\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main funding source for Luminor are customer deposits. Since the creation of Luminor, the Bank has been funded by former parent \\r\\nbanks in the form of a syndicated loan. Taking into account Luminor’s plan to become an independent self-financed financial institution, \\r\\nparent funding will be gradually substituted by other sources of funding – from clients’ deposits to the funding received through capital \\r\\nmarkets. \\r\\n\\r\\nFunding tranches maturing in 2020 will be paid back or prolonged according to the terms of the Facility Agreement and Luminor’s \\r\\nfunding needs. Terms and conditions of the Facility Agreement – under which funding from former parents is provided – were modified \\r\\ndue to the changes of ownership in 2019. Due to the changes the commitment is partly or fully collateralized. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is defined as the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable \\r\\nfunding over a one-year time horizon. The minimum requirement for NSFR is 100%, however the Group has a substantial buffer and \\r\\nmaintains a higher ratio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has set the limits in place for various measures, including LCR, NSFR, liquidity gaps, and manages those within the set limits \\r\\nby ensuring the proper maturity structure of its assets and liabilities, for example, via issuing long dated debt. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 65  \\r\\n\\r\\nOff-balance sheet items \\r\\n\\r\\nThe analysis of nominal off-balance sheet items by remaining maturity is as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nOn demand and \\r\\n\\r\\nless than 1 month \\r\\n\\r\\n1-3 \\r\\n\\r\\nmonths \\r\\n\\r\\n3-12 \\r\\n\\r\\nmonths \\r\\n1-5 years \\r\\n\\r\\nOver 5 \\r\\n\\r\\nyears \\r\\nTOTAL \\r\\n\\r\\nLoan commitments 1 225 039 0 0 0 0 1 225 039 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial guarantees 110 226 0 0 0 0 110 226 \\r\\n\\r\\nPerformance guarantees 150 037 0 0 0 0 150 037 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther commitments* 398 246 0 0 0 0 398 246 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 1 883 548 0 0 0 0 1 883 548 \\r\\n\\r\\n* Other commitments given include different type of guarantees (warranty, payment and advance payment quarantees, etc)  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nOn demand and \\r\\n\\r\\nless than 1 \\r\\n\\r\\nmonth \\r\\n\\r\\n1-3 months 3-12 months 1-5 years Over 5 years TOTAL \\r\\n\\r\\nLoan \\r\\n\\r\\ncommitments \\r\\n1 134 434 0 0 0 0 1 134 434 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial \\r\\n\\r\\nguarantees \\r\\n110 655 0 0 0 0 110 655 \\r\\n\\r\\nPerformance \\r\\n\\r\\nguarantees \\r\\n74 647 0 0 0 0 74 647 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther \\r\\n\\r\\ncommitments* \\r\\n469 080 0 0 0 0 469 080 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 1 788 816 0 0 0 0 1 788 816 \\r\\n\\r\\n* Other commitments given include different type of guarantees ( warranty, payment and advance payment quarantees, etc)  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity buffer and collateral management \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a contractual agreement for funding in place with shareholders DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank Abp. This strongly \\r\\nmitigates the likelihood of funding liquidity risk which may be caused by deposit run off, wholesale funding risk (roll over and new \\r\\nissuance), unexpected outflows from off-balance sheet obligations and legal risks (e.g. not being able to issue funding due to legal \\r\\nrestrictions). As the Group is moving towards more reliance on self-funding rather than on support from shareholders, other funding \\r\\nsources are being established or are already in place for diversifying the funding base. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group is taking part in the ECB’s Eurosystem open market operations. In particular, the Group is a user of the ECB Targeted Long \\r\\nTerm Refinancing Operations (TLTRO). In addition, a significant part of funding is attracted through retail and corporate deposits. \\r\\nMoreover, the Group has already issued 650 million EUR of its own senior debt securities and 500 million EUR of covered bonds, and is \\r\\nconsidering to increase this amount in the future even more, which would further diversify the funding opportunities. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main part of the liquidity buffer is held with the Central Bank Accounts where the Group held 2.6 billion EUR at the end of March \\r\\n2020. This buffer can be utilized at any time when the need arises. \\r\\n\\r\\nSurvival horizon \\r\\n\\r\\nThe survival horizon indicator within the Risk Appetite Framework captures the liquidity buffer available outright to be used in liquidity \\r\\nstress situations within 12 months. It can also be described as the availability of liquidity which obviates the need to take any \\r\\nextraordinary measures.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThree different scenarios are considered while measuring survival horizon: bank-specific, market-wide and the combination of the most \\r\\nsevere assumptions from the previous two. Stress testing assumptions include but are not limited to severe deposit withdrawals, \\r\\nincluding early termination of term deposits and run-off of top 5 depositors, deterioration of financial assets, decrease of loan \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 66  \\r\\n\\r\\nrepayment levels, increase of utilization of credit commitments, availability of credit lines from shareholders based on facility \\r\\nagreements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity buffer for the survival horizon indicator is strongly affected by the assumption of outgoing deposits in the first few days \\r\\nand weeks of the turbulence period, with the smaller continuous run-off occurring in the following months. Due to rather high \\r\\nconcentration of top depositors, the Group tests resistance towards a run-off of the 5 largest depositors as well. However, Luminor has \\r\\nsubstantial unused credit line from shareholders which can be utilized any time based on the mutual facilities agreement. Furthermore, \\r\\nthe majority of liquid assets are held with central banks in the form of cash. The previous mentioned agreement and considerable \\r\\nvolume of highly liquid assets substantially softens the consequences of deteriorating liquidity in case of high outflows.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s liquidity situation is sufficiently strong to survive severe external shocks. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 67  \\r\\n\\r\\nEconomic sectors \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following tables break down Loans to customers at their carrying amounts  as categorised by the economic sectors of our \\r\\ncounterparties.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and loans to central bank, credit institutions, and customers \\r\\n\\r\\nGroup \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n31 March 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash on Hand 135 955 140 518 \\r\\n\\r\\nCentral Banks 2 619 986 2 783 501 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 109 048 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Institutions 13 894 29 255 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic Sector 156 307 174 715 \\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual Customer 5 529 350 5 606 413 \\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness Customers 4 228 346 4 412 164 \\r\\n\\r\\nAgriculture, forestry and fishing 318 874 337 080 \\r\\n\\r\\nMining and quarrying 15 818 23 658 \\r\\n\\r\\nManufacturing 527 550 571 675 \\r\\n\\r\\nElectricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply 123 435 132 176 \\r\\n\\r\\nWater supply 29 962 31 948 \\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction 191 166 197 785 \\r\\n\\r\\nWholesale and retail trade 834 168 937 197 \\r\\n\\r\\nTransport and storage 405 822 394 660 \\r\\n\\r\\nAccommodation and food service activities 44 307 48 768 \\r\\n\\r\\nInformation and communication 23 639 26 558 \\r\\n\\r\\nReal estate activities 1 114 141 1 132 767 \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessional, scientific and technical activities 229 120 210 089 \\r\\n\\r\\nAdministrative and support service activities 211 697 209 227 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic administration and defence, compulsory social security 4 780 5 358 \\r\\n\\r\\nEducation 6 526 7 106 \\r\\n\\r\\nHuman health services and social work activities 21 793 21 432 \\r\\n\\r\\nArts, entertainment and recreation 12 544 13 607 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther services 113 004 111 073 \\r\\n\\r\\nTOTAL 12 792 886 13 288 211 \\r\\n\\r\\nOPERATIONAL RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nOperational risk in Luminor is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or \\r\\nfrom external events. This definition includes legal risk, but excludes strategic and reputational risk. Operational risk management in \\r\\nLuminor is governed by the Operational Risk Policy. Key principles are that operational risk should be low/medium and Luminor’s \\r\\noperational risk management framework should ensure that the risk of unexpected losses is reduced. Each manager and process owner \\r\\nis responsible for the management of risks inherent to the activities and processes of their area of responsibility and for fostering a \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 68  \\r\\n\\r\\nsound risk management culture. The Operational Risk Management Department is an independent internal control function within the \\r\\nsecond line of defence and covers operational risk management, information security and personal data protection.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOperational risk management in the first quarter of 2020 was affected by the spread of COVID-19. At the end of February 2020 central \\r\\ncrisis management was initiated to assure business continuity and resilience and to protect Luminor employees. As main mitigation \\r\\nactions, remote working, social distancing and basic hygiene methods were used for employee protection. To ensure business \\r\\ncontinuity, business continuity plans were reviewed and updated, particular for critical services. Also critical vendor continuity readiness \\r\\nwas reviewed and assessed. Throughout the crisis so far, all of Luminor’s business processes and client services are operational without \\r\\nnegative impact for Luminor customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor management is kept updated on the status of operational risk through periodic and ad hoc risk reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s regulatory capital consists fully of Tier 1/Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Tier1/CET1 capital consists of ordinary shares, \\r\\nshare premium, mandatory reserve, retained earnings of the previous financial year, the audited profit of the current financial year and \\r\\nless the intangible assets, deferred tax assets, revaluation profit of investment properties, current year losses, if any, and other \\r\\ndeductions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital is calculated and allocated for risk coverage following the regulations in the CRD IV and CRR of the European Union and the \\r\\nlocal legal acts. The Group’s objectives in capital management are as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\n• consistency with Luminor Group’s long-term strategy (including meeting the risk appetite of the Group) and the Dividend policy; \\r\\n\\r\\n• the ability to pursue the business objectives; \\r\\n\\r\\n• fulfilment of both internal and external capitalisation targets (capital adequacy); \\r\\n\\r\\n• sufficient and proper composition of capital that would withstand stressful events. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital adequacy assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in accordance with the information guidelines for the risk \\r\\nmanagement and capital adequacy disclosure (Pillar 3) report. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 69  \\r\\n\\r\\nQuantitative information regarding the capital managed by the Group is presented below: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the prudential requirements, the Pillar 2 requirement set by the ECB in the 2019 Joint Decision on Capital and the Systemic \\r\\nrisk and Countercyclical risk buffer requirements set by the Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian regulators, Luminor Group is required to \\r\\nhold capital exceeding 10.8% CET1 and 15.2% Total capital.

The Group does not apply any VaR or other internal models for the calculation of the market risk capital \\r\\nrequirement and applies the Basic Indicators Approach for calculating the operational risk capital requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk-weighted assets are measured by means of risk weights classified according to the nature of each asset and counterparty, \\r\\ntaking into account the collaterals and guarantees eligible for risk mitigation. A similar treatment with some adjustments is adopted \\r\\nfor the off-balance sheet exposures. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group reviews and improves the risk identification and management policies and procedures according to changes in the Group’s \\r\\nactivities and financial situation at least once a year. Amendments and updates are mostly done during the annual internal capital \\r\\nadequacy assessment process when significant risks are to be reassessed or identified and assessed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group complied with all externally imposed capital requirements during the reporting period.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGOING CONCERN \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor’s management is fully convinced of a stable and balanced performance going forward and, based on that, prepared these \\r\\nfinancial statements on a going concern basis.  \\r\\n\\r\\n4.

The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of its \\r\\nfixed rate senior unsecured bonds. Trade date for 200 million EUR and 150 million EUR interest swap agreements is 10 October 2018, \\r\\neffective date is 18 October 2018 and maturity date is 18 October 2021. For 300 million EUR interest swap agreement trade date is 11 \\r\\nJune 2019, effective date is 21 June 2019 and maturity date 21 October 2022. For 500 million EUR interest swap agreement trade date \\r\\nis 04 March 2020, effective date is 11 March 2020 and maturity date 11 March 2025. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instruments as the terms of the interest rate swaps match \\r\\nthe terms of the fixed rate loan (i.e. notional amount, maturity, payment and reset dates). The Group has established a hedge ratio of \\r\\n1:1 for the hedging relationships, as the underlying risk of the interest rate swaps is identical to the hedged risk component. To test \\r\\nhedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging \\r\\ninstrument against the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.  \\r\\n\\r\\nHedge ineffectiveness can theoretically arise from:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• A different interest rate curve applied to discount the hedged item and hedging instrument;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Differences in the timing of cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument, also a different day count;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instrument and hedged item. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 74  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 1 150 000 5 972 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 650 000 1 898 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n*Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n11.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where the \\r\\nfair values of financial assets and liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active markets, they \\r\\nare determined in a way that unobservable inputs used to measure fair value would reflect the assumptions that market participants \\r\\nwould use when pricing assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risk. Where observable market data is not available, \\r\\nexpert judgment is required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements, the above mentioned techniques \\r\\nrelated to unobservable inputs were not used as no such financial assets and liabilities exist on the statement of financial position of \\r\\nthe Group. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 80  \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTISED COSTS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR  \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020 31 March 2020 31 December 2019 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortised cost         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central \\r\\nbanks \\r\\n\\r\\n2 755 941  2 755 941  2 924 019  2 924 019  \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 109 048  109 048  141 645  141 645  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 9 927 897  10 027 176  10 222 547  10 324 772  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 12 792 886  12 892 165  13 288 211  13 390 436  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities         \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortised \\r\\ncost \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n271 580  271 580  980 692  980 692  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 9 958 280  9 958 280  10 235 443  10 235 443  \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 1 156 054  1 154 774  651 716  653 967  \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 53 019  53 019  45 303  45 303  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 11 438 933  11 437 653  11 913 154  11 915 405  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarises the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities. Financial \\r\\ninstruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the \\r\\nmeasurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and shall be used without \\r\\nadjustment to measure fair value whenever available; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 2 — valuation techniques for which inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 are observable for the asset \\r\\nor liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be \\r\\nobservable for a substantial part of the term of the asset or liability; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 3 — valuation techniques for which inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to \\r\\nmeasure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there \\r\\nis little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective \\r\\nremains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset \\r\\nor owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs shall reflect the assumptions that market participants would use when \\r\\npricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk. \\r\\n\\r\\n

ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 83  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:  \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss (Pension Funds) - The value date method is used in the \\r\\nacquisition of pension fund units managed by Luminor Pensions Estonia AS and they are initially recognised at acquisition cost, which \\r\\nis the fair value paid for them. Pension fund units are revalued according to the effective net asset value on the balance sheet date.The \\r\\nfollowing methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Cash and cash balances with central banks – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at the same \\r\\nprice in an orderly transaction;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Due from other credit institutions – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at the same price \\r\\nin an orderly transaction. Due from other credit institutions are demand deposits;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Loans to customers – fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows with the base curve used by the \\r\\nBank (6m Euribor curve as average for all loans) as adjusted by credit riks factors. In 2018 Luminor had various different \\r\\napproaches to the fair value estimation (in the legacy organizations) and that Luminor has made an effort in 2019 to align the \\r\\nmethodologies across the different geographies. The current approach is in accordance with Fair Value procedure. Same \\r\\nvaluation technique is applied to all loan classes and accordingly all loan classes are classified under fair value level 3;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (debt securities) - for domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, \\r\\nthe quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading \\r\\noffers in the form of prices, yields or equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid \\r\\nprices shall be used taking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no \\r\\nquotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are clearly incorrect or \\r\\nartificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or similar; \\r\\n\\r\\n• The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the interest rates for \\r\\nitems with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured using the assumptions that market \\r\\nparticipants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (equities, debt securities):  \\r\\n\\r\\n• The quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source for local equities. These are securities for \\r\\nwhich active market exists based on the turnover, meaning availability of quotes at which market participants \\r\\ntransact in the local stock market. The quotes of foreign equities shall be taken from Bloomberg giving the priority \\r\\nto the primary market, and then to the country of issuer if the active market exists there. Otherwise, the market \\r\\nwith the highest liquidity (turnover) shall be used as a source for pricing. If the quotes in primary data sources are \\r\\nclearly incorrect or artificial, the price of particular equity shall be derived from liquid market data using sources \\r\\nlike Bloomberg or similar. Correctness of the quotes described above are the subject of expert judgment of the \\r\\nMarket and Liquidity Risk Management Department member together with the Bank’s Markets Department’s \\r\\ndealer responsible for equity trading. For equities of non-listed companies for which active market does not exist, \\r\\nany available trusted public information on recent trades shall be used for the pricing of the equity. Alternatively, \\r\\ndividend discount model shall be used to determine the price of equity. Expert opinion based on other available \\r\\nrelated market data shall be used for pricing of equity if the previously described methods are not possible;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• For domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the \\r\\npriority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading offers in the form of prices, yields or \\r\\nequivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid prices shall be used taking \\r\\nthe data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no quotes available \\r\\nfrom local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are clearly incorrect or artificial, \\r\\nthe prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or \\r\\nsimilar;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the interest rates for \\r\\nitems with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured using the assumptions that market \\r\\nparticipants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Derivative financial instruments – market data from financial data vendors, electronic trading platforms or third-party valuation \\r\\nare used for valuation purposes. The derivatives represent non-complex products valued with generally accepted models. \\r\\nValuation inputs are derived from the market data;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 84  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Loans and deposits from credit institutions – the fair value of loans equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the loans from credit \\r\\ninstitutions is under market conditions. Expected cash flows of the liabilities from the banks are discounted with the same \\r\\nmarket rates as loans. Loans from credit institutions are long-term. Deposits from credit institutions are demand deposits. The \\r\\nfair value of deposits equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the deposits from credit institutions is under market conditions;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Deposits from customers – the gross carrying amount of demand deposits as a fair value is applied as an approximation due to \\r\\nvery short maturities;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Debt securities issued – the debt securities issued by the Bank are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs and are \\r\\nsubsequently carried at amortized cost using effective interest rate (EIR) method. The fair value is calculated by discounting the \\r\\nfuture cash flows using the market interest rate yield curve. \\r\\n\\r\\n18.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as the Management Board. The Management \\r\\nBoard monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and \\r\\nperformance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit before tax and is measured consistently with profit before \\r\\ntax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of expenses after internal funds transfer pricing, as \\r\\nmanagement primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a performance measure. Fees and commission \\r\\nincome for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made between different product categories for segment \\r\\nreporting.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth Management. \\r\\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. Corporate Banking segment \\r\\nservices business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager and all leasing customers who do not have a bank relationship. \\r\\nRetail Banking segment services business customers without a dedicated relationship manager and private individuals not belonging to \\r\\nWealth Management segment. Wealth Management services wealthy private individuals and holding companies associated with those \\r\\nindividuals. Results of other operating segments are included in Other segment.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 86  \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments (including \\r\\ninternal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Other segment) and income and expenses not booked on \\r\\ncustomer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using internally agreed allocation mechanisms. Only assets and \\r\\nliabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating segments are reported under the respective segments, all other balance \\r\\nsheet items are reported under Other segment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first quarter of 2020 it was decided to transfer customers with leasing exposures but without a relationship to bank entities \\r\\nfrom Other segment to Corporate segment and restatement was made also to historic periods. From the first quarter of 2020 Luminor \\r\\nstarted applying Activity Based Costing to allocate personnel costs, administrative costs and depreciation between operating segments \\r\\nand restatement was also made to segment split of costs to 2019 figures. \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Corporate Retail \\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagment \\r\\nOther Total \\r\\n\\r\\nQ1 2020           \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group           \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 30 437 27 688 1 789 -5 834 54 080 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet fees & commission income 6 574 10 508 504 184 17 770 \\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income 3 059 1 285 94 3 363 7 801 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther income 773 407 0 -578 602 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal income 40 843 39 888 2 387 -2 865 80 253 \\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel costs, administrative costs and depreciation  -24 978 -41 726 -2 093 142 -68 653 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (losses/ reversal) on loans to customers -23 857 -3 727 -343 1 516 -26 411 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther 0 0 0 -4 154 -4 154 \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit before Tax -7 992 -5 565 -49 -5 359 -18 965 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Corporate Retail \\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagment \\r\\nOther Total \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2020           \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Group           \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 4 700 796 5 330 415 82 017 -185 331 9 927 897 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal assets 4 700 796 5 330 415 82 017 -185 331 9 927 897 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 4 934 973 4 083 954 920 939 18 414 9 958 280 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal liabilities 4 934 973 4 083 954 920 939 18 414 9 958 280 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 87  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Corporate Retail \\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagment \\r\\nOther Total \\r\\n\\r\\nQ1 2019           \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group           \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 34 582 26 650 1 982 600 63 814 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet fees & commission income 6 945 10 648 532 589 18 714 \\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income 2 930 1 468 96 2 608 7 102 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther income 312 208 0 2 122 2 642 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal income 44 769 38 974 2 610 5 919 92 272 \\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel costs, administrative costs and depreciation  -26 541 -38 842 -2 406 133 -67 656 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (losses/ reversal) on loans to customers 1 130 6 430 39 -323 7 276 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther 0 0 0 -3 882 -3 882 \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit before Tax 19 358 6 562 243 1 847 28 010 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Corporate Retail \\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagment \\r\\nOther Total \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019           \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group           \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 4 925 549 5 401 323 82 047 -186 372 10 222 547 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal assets 4 925 549 5 401 323 82 047 -186 372 10 222 547 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 5 094 953 4 185 510 945 223 9 756 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal liabilities 5 094 953 4 185 510 945 223 9 756 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n20.

Constructive cooperation between governments, \\r\\nsupervisors, banks and customers made it possible to provide the early and necessary support to private individuals, as well as \\r\\ncompanies during those difficult times.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic governments have launched programs to mitigate the negative effects from the pandemic and to stimulate the economies. \\r\\nLuminor is utilising the state guarantees to the benefit of our customers. In addition to continuously providing financing, we are \\r\\nhelping to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic by offering simplified grace period solutions to all of our qualified customers. \\r\\nWe are supporting our customers further by extending the loan principal payment moratoriums until the end of September 2020 \\r\\nwhile retaining the existing conditions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the crisis, Luminor kept its customer service centres open while implementing strict measures to protect our customers \\r\\nand employees. To prevent the spread of virus, we were able to mobilise over 75% of our employees to working remotely in a very \\r\\nshort time. This experience has changed our ways of working and even coming out of the crisis, we have further adopted flexible \\r\\nworking time and place principles and encourage our employees to split their working days between office and remote work.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued the year with a strong financial standing, which is a solid platform to be there for our customers throughout the \\r\\ncrisis and to support them in coming out of it. Our funding structure was further improved with a continuous increase in deposits. By \\r\\nreaching loans to deposits ratio of 93%, Luminor has achieved fully independent funding structure and paid back the utilized part of \\r\\ncredit line from DNB and Nordea, while retaining the credit line as a stand-by facility. Net profit in the second quarter amounted to \\r\\n13.5 million EUR compared to negative result in the previous quarter, when larger loan loss provisions were recognised due to the \\r\\nspread of COVID-19.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the timelines being impacted by the pandemic, continuous progress was made with the carve-out across all three countries. \\r\\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, Luminor finalised the migration of customers in Lithuania to the common technology platform, \\r\\nbecoming fully independent of the systems of both DNB and Nordea. By the end of June, also more than 99% of Luminor’s customer \\r\\nbase in Latvia was using our common independent technology platforms, with the remaining customers being migrated in July.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the volume of deposits in the Retail Banking segment increased by 245 million EUR in the second quarter of 2020, the pandemic \\r\\nimpacted new sales across the product groups.  One of the top priorities for Retail Banking in the second quarter was to optimise its \\r\\nprocesses to improve the experience for customers and staff. The range of online services was expanded further by launching remote \\r\\ncustomer onboarding in Lithuania, after having successfully implemented it in Latvia. The service will be extended to Estonia in the \\r\\nthird quarter of 2020. Retail banking also continued with the transformation to strengthen its customer service process and advisory \\r\\nconcept. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe top priority for the Corporate Banking team in the second quarter of 2020 was to help corporate customers cope with the impact \\r\\nof COVID-19 on their businesses. Principal payment grace periods were granted for approximately 15.2% of the total corporate loan \\r\\nportfolio. Loan loss provisions totalled 12 million EUR, which was half less than in the first quarter. Loan volumes contracted by 5% in \\r\\nthe second quarter as demand for new loans dropped significantly in March and only started to slightly recover in June. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second quarter of 2020 saw continuous growth for the Wealth Management segment with the assets under management of \\r\\nPrivate Banking reaching 1.5 billion EUR and pension assets 1.4 billion EUR, a 9% increase for both from same quarter in 2019 and \\r\\n11% from the first quarter of 2020. The growth was supported by the high interest of existing and newly onboarded customers \\r\\ntowards the new Luminor investor platform. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor focuses continuously on being proactive and vigilant in preventing and detecting financial crime. During the second quarter \\r\\nof 2020, the financial crime risk management framework to prevent, detect, manage and report potential financial crime risk was \\r\\nfurther enhanced, supporting its conservative approach towards money laundering and financial crime. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is sure to be significant, the Baltic economies were strong when entering the \\r\\ncrisis, with a private and public sector debt in relation to GDP among the lowest in Europe. The Baltic states have also managed to \\r\\ncontain the virus outbreak relatively well. This may cushion the economic shock and promote a subsequent recovery from the \\r\\npandemic. All our joint efforts should now concentrate on restarting economies while keeping in mind safety considerations. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 4  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are grateful to our customers for turning to us for advice and support during those trying times and we assure them that we will \\r\\ncontinue to be here for them when coming out of the crisis.  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\n\\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 5  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral information \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor) was established on 1 October 2017 through the merger of the Baltic operations of DNB Bank ASA \\r\\n(Commercial Register no. 984 851 006, DNB) and Nordea Bank Abp (Commercial Register no. 2858394-9, Nordea) to create a new-\\r\\ngeneration financial service provider for local businesses and financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 it was announced that the transaction signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB, Nordea and US-based \\r\\nprivate equity firm Blackstone had been concluded and as a result a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone \\r\\nacquired a 60.1% majority stake in the bank. The bank’s initial owners Nordea and DNB each retained a 19.95% equity stake in \\r\\nLuminor, but an arrangement has been made by the consortium and Nordea for the purchase of Nordea’s remaining stake over the \\r\\ncoming years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with some 900 000 clients, 2 494 employees, and market share \\r\\nof 15.6% in deposits and 17.6% in lending as at the end of June 2020. Luminor has total shareholders’ equity of 1.6 billion EUR and it \\r\\nis capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 22.0%. Luminor’s core business is serving entrepreneurial people in the Baltics with a primary focus \\r\\non local companies and the financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers its customers a wide range of products and services through all possible channels, digital and physical, with 34 \\r\\ncustomer service centres in total in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, of which nine are meet-up points. Luminor owns 363 ATMs \\r\\nthroughout the Baltic states, and additionally provides services through 100 ATMs in partnership with other financial services \\r\\nproviders.  \\r\\n\\r\\n30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Estonia Latvia Lithuania GroupGr Total  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of customers ~130 000 ~222 000 ~558 000 ~910 000 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket shares      \\r\\n\\r\\nLending 12.6% 22.4% 19.4% 17.6% \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits 8.9% 15.7% 20.8% 15.6% \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of client service \\r\\ncentres, including meet- up \\r\\npoints \\r\\n\\r\\n8 10 16 34  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of employees 595 883 1 016 2 494 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe economic implications of the COVID-19 outbreak are certain to be significant as the pandemic has severely impacted growth \\r\\nacross all the regions of the world, including the euro area. The June 2020 World Economic Outlook of the International Monetary \\r\\nFund projects that global growth will contract by 4.9% in 2020, which will constitute the worst downturn since the Great Depression. \\r\\nGlobal output is expected to rebound by 5.4% in 2021. The uncertainty around this forecast is however greater than usual. Recent \\r\\ndata from economic surveys point towards economic stabilisation though, and to recovery taking hold in countries that have moved \\r\\nfurther towards taming the virus and lifting lockdown restrictions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe impact on the euro area, including the Baltic economies, is likely to be concentrated in the first half of 2020, and the recovery will \\r\\ntake hold from the third quarter of the year. The euro area is the key destination for Baltic exports, and it had already been hit quite \\r\\nevidently by the pandemic and the deteriorating economic environment in the first quarter of 2020. Particularly notable was that the \\r\\neuro area turned from soft annual growth of 1% over the year at the end of last year to a drop of 3.1% over the year and 3.6% over \\r\\nthe quarter in the first quarter, reflecting the substantial drag imposed by both consumption and investment on top of contracting \\r\\ntrade. The Baltic economies are famously open and were the fastest growing euro area economies in the past three years, but the \\r\\ntrend in their growth was gradually moderating well before the outbreak of COVID-19 as global trade became more muted. The \\r\\ndeceleration in growth in the first quarter was however more modest than the average in the euro-area as yearly growth held up at \\r\\n-0.8% in Estonia, -1.5% in Latvia and 2.4% in Lithuania. This can be attributed to labour markets being strong before the pandemic hit, \\r\\nwhich supported domestic demand.     \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 6  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic states have managed to contain the virus outbreak relatively well. External borders were swiftly closed and a quarantine \\r\\nperiod was introduced with proportional and partial lockdown measures as needed to limit the spread of the virus immediately after \\r\\nthe first COVID-19 positive domestic cases were confirmed in mid-March. The number of new virus cases each day was brought down \\r\\nto single digits as early as mid-May, with no second round outbreaks occurring after the economies reopened from the partial \\r\\nlockdown measures that were brought in to limit the spread of the virus. Each of the three Baltic states followed its own strategy and \\r\\nmedical plan to contain the spread of the virus as was the case in the other euro area countries. A common characteristic was that \\r\\nno full lock-down of the economies was deemed necessary as manufacturing industry largely continued to fulfil orders and several \\r\\nnon-food shops, such as building materials stores, remained open during the quarantine period in Estonia and Latvia. Furthermore, \\r\\nthe medical systems successfully maintained sufficient free capacity even as the spread of the virus was contained by the broad-based \\r\\ndistancing measures.    \\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth in the Baltic economies has been robust in recent years, as GDP growth has outpaced the euro area average by a significant \\r\\nmargin. Baltic private and public sector debt in relation to GDP meanwhile has stood in stark contrast to where it was going into the \\r\\nGlobal Financial Crisis as it has been among the lowest in Europe, and this may cushion the economic shock and promote a subsequent \\r\\nrecovery from the pandemic. Domestic demand and business activity held up well in the region until the pandemic started, as very \\r\\ntight labour markets supported wage growth in high single digits and strong consumer demand. This strong starting point explains \\r\\nthe relatively soft contraction in the Baltic economies in the first quarter, but it does not entirely insulate the region’s economies from \\r\\nthe impact of the pandemic.   \\r\\n\\r\\nSharp recessions in the Baltic economies, concentrated in the second quarter, are likely to be followed by a fairly swift recovery from \\r\\nthe third quarter onwards, assuming that there is no major re-emergence of the pandemic in Europe. A combination of factors will \\r\\nfacilitate this. Firstly, the key trading partners of the Baltic states, including Germany and the Nordic countries, have weathered the \\r\\npandemic quite well and have already taken substantial steps to reopen their economies, with economic data improving. Secondly, \\r\\nApril and May probably saw the lowest point in activity in the Baltics as retail sales started to rebound from May while economic \\r\\nconfidence recovered in both the two months after April once restrictions were lifted. Consumer demand has benefitted from fiscal \\r\\nsupport with unemployment keeping growing. Furthermore cross-border travel restrictions between the three Baltic states were \\r\\nlifted from mid-May, after which the EU Commission recommended that Schengen Associated States lift their internal border controls \\r\\nby 15 June. Tourism is, however, expected to recover only gradually in Europe.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall the recovery from COVID-19 has already started in the Baltic states following their re-opening. The European Central Bank \\r\\n(the ECB) has delivered substantial support to the euro area as a whole, and the Baltic states will benefit on top of this from targeted \\r\\nextraordinary fiscal support measures at both the national and EU levels to mitigate the consequences of the crisis. Targeted economic \\r\\npolicy continues to cushion household losses and provide support to firms to boost demand. There is no doubt that the loss of activity \\r\\nin the coming quarters will be significant, but it is crucial that the economies can recover swiftly as the spread of the virus remains \\r\\ncontained and the recovery in European economies gets underway with substantial economic policy support in the pipeline.   \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 7  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19 impact on Luminor \\r\\n\\r\\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the economies of the Baltic states is still being assessed, and some sectors and companies will not recover \\r\\nfor some years yet. It is natural in that case that, for direct or precautionary reasons, many customers will need to ask their banks for \\r\\ngrace periods for their financial obligations.    \\r\\n\\r\\nTo help our customers withstand the crisis, Luminor is offering simplified grace period solutions to both private individuals and \\r\\ncorporate customers in all three Baltic states. As at the end of the second quarter 2020, Luminor had granted grace periods to \\r\\ncorporate customers representing 15.2% of the corporate loan portfolio volume, and grace periods to private customers that covered \\r\\n8.0% of mortgage loans and 2.8% of other loans, mostly leases and consumer finance, across the Baltic states. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian governments have followed those in other countries around the world by launching \\r\\nprogrammes to stimulate their economies in order to mitigate the harm caused by the pandemic. Luminor is utilising the state \\r\\nguarantees to the benefit of our customers. Our main partners in this in the second quarter were Kredex in Estonia, Altum in Latvia, \\r\\nand Invega in Lithuania, and we expect that we will soon start working with the Estonian Rural Development Foundation and the \\r\\nLithuanian Agricultural Credit Guarantee Fund as well.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor kept its customer service centres open throughout the crisis but put strict measures in place to protect our staff and \\r\\ncustomers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo prevent the spread of virus, over 75% of our employees were working remotely. After the crisis has ended, we are returning to \\r\\noffices, but also encourage our staff to split their working days between the office and remote work. \\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness development \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor completed its cross-border merger on 2 January 2019 and continues its operations in all the three Baltic countries through \\r\\nthe bank headquartered in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all assets, rights and \\r\\nliabilities of Luminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank \\r\\ncontinues its activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches. A new organisational set up and a new \\r\\ngovernance structure were also introduced, and new members of management bodies were appointed.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe deposits and financial instruments of the depositors and customers using the investment services of Luminor Bank AS and its \\r\\nLatvian branch and Lithuanian branch are guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and investor protection scheme established and \\r\\noperated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at the end of the second quarter of 2020, by reaching loans to deposits ratio of 93%, Luminor has achieved fully independent \\r\\nfunding structure and paid back the utilized part of credit line from DNB and Nordea, while retaining the credit line as a stand-by \\r\\nfacility. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe timelines for the technology programme were impacted by COVID-19, but continuous progress was made even so in the carve-\\r\\nout (separation from DNB and Nordea systems) across all three countries. During the second quarter of 2020, Luminor finalised the \\r\\nmigration of customers in Lithuania to the common technology platform we are targeting, and from the end of June we are operating \\r\\ntechnology platforms that are fully independent of the systems of either DNB or Nordea. Work to finalise the migration and \\r\\ndecommissioning of historical data is currently ongoing so that we can finally stop using the technology services provided by DNB and \\r\\nNordea under the Transitional Service Agreement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPhased customer migration made further progress in Latvia, and more than 99% of Luminor’s customer base was using our common \\r\\nindependent technology platforms by the end of June. The remaining customers were migrated in July, after which work will \\r\\ncommence on migrating and decommissioning historical data.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe testing of the new banking platform continued in Estonia, and it was launched  for pilot- users in July. Market launch and customer \\r\\nmigration are planned for the fourth quarter of 2020. The adverse impact of COVID-19 has delayed the launch, but we are still \\r\\nexpecting that the carve-out in Estonia will be completed in 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor further strengthened its Daily Banking offering in the second quarter of 2020 by continuing the launch and promotion of new \\r\\nservices and products that had got going in the first quarter. Following the success in Latvia, remote customer onboarding was \\r\\nlaunched in Lithuania in the second quarter. The service will be extended to Estonia in the third quarter.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 8  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe e-Commerce Gateway, which was launched for Mass Business customers at the end of the first quarter, received 310 applications \\r\\nand converted 159 of them into agreements. The e-Commerce Gateway provides card acquiring services that let businesses accept \\r\\nVISA and Mastercard cards, and it uses the Open Banking application programming interfaces (APIs) of major banks so that account-\\r\\nto-account payments can be acquired.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor also launched its Black Card in Lithuania. This credit card is an excellent value proposition for domestic and overseas use and \\r\\nthe aim is for it to become the target credit card for Luminor customers in all three countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe volume of deposits in the Retail Banking segment increased by 245 million EUR in the second quarter of 2020, which was a \\r\\nsignificant step up from the increase of 65 million EUR in the same period last year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19 meant that plans for marketing communications had to be adjusted and a number of campaigns and other activities aimed \\r\\nat gaining new customers had to be postponed. New sales of mortgages were down by 6.2 million EUR compared to previous quarter. \\r\\nInterest from customers in taking housing loans had returned by early May to where it was before the pandemic, but stricter scoring \\r\\ncriteria were held in place to limit potential risk exposure. The lending strategy was revised at the same time, and the gradual \\r\\nimplementation of it started to support the acquisition of target customers. A training programme on housing loans was created for \\r\\nfrontline staff and was launched in all three countries with six different training sessions and workshops. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the top priorities for Retail Banking in the second quarter was to optimise its processes to improve the experience for \\r\\ncustomers and staff. A number of processes were simplified and changes like the e-Commerce Gateway and remote onboarding were \\r\\nintroduced.  \\r\\n\\r\\nRetail Banking started the transformation process in the second quarter through which it will support Luminor’s strategic goal of \\r\\nbecoming a Digital Retail bank. This process includes a redesign of the customer service process and advisory concept, and an \\r\\noptimisation of channels and the organisational structure.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe top priority for the Corporate Banking team in the second quarter of 2020 was to support our corporate customers to cope with \\r\\nthe impact of COVID-19 on their businesses. Principal payment grace periods have been granted to corporate loans, representing \\r\\n15.2% of the total Baltic corporate loan portfolio volume.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoan volumes contracted by a further 5% in the second quarter as demand for new loans dropped significantly in March and only \\r\\nstarted to recover in June. More than 80% of the loan book continued to be amortised to its original schedule. Deposit volumes were \\r\\nunchanged and we continued to work to improve the granularity of our deposit base. Overall income increased slightly on the back \\r\\nof a rise in net interest income that came from both higher margins on lending and lower costs for funding. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second quarter of 2020 saw continuous growth for the Wealth Management segment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus on growing Private Banking meant that assets under management reached 1.5 billion EUR in the second quarter, which was \\r\\n9% more than in the same quarter of 2019 and 11% more than in the first quarter of 2020. The growth was supported by the high \\r\\ninterest of existing and newly onboarded customers towards the new Luminor investor platform, and high customer satisfaction with \\r\\nprovided Private Banking services.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPension assets increased to 1.4 billion EUR, which was 9% more than a year earlier and 11% more than in the previous quarter. By \\r\\nthe end of the second quarter Luminor had approximately 289 000 second pillar pension customers and 62 000 third pillar customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe safety and well-being of Luminor employees and customers remained our top priority in the second quarter of 2020 in all our \\r\\nactivities. Even as we continued to offer banking services to our customers and kept our branches open, we took comprehensive \\r\\nmeasures to assure the safety of our staff and customers. We used remote working as far as possible, with over 75% of our employees \\r\\nworking off-site, and we paid extra attention to cleaning and to the availability of disinfectants in our facilities and ATMs, while also \\r\\nproviding protective equipment to all our staff who needed it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also encouraged our customers to use digital services as much as possible, and we had more people advising customers at our \\r\\ncall centres and extended the working hours of those call centres. The remote onboarding service, which was already operating in \\r\\nLatvia, was also introduced in Lithuania in the second quarter. Online meetings, video meetings and a pre-booking system were \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 9  \\r\\n\\r\\nintroduced for Customer Service Centres to increase the share of remote services provided. All new payment cards or reissued \\r\\npayment cards were sent to customers by post, and the Baltic ratio for this was 95%.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo help our customers to mitigate the economic impact caused by the pandemic, Luminor is offering simplified grace period solutions \\r\\nfor both private individuals and corporate customers and is extending the lending moratoriums until the end of September while \\r\\nretaining the same conditions. \\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple webinars were held in each of the three countries that provided Luminor customers insightful and practical information \\r\\nabout working remotely, leading teams, developments in credit markets, and information security.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe community investment project Here for You was successfully completed in the second quarter as Luminor helped nine different \\r\\nbusinesses and NGOs in the Baltic states to build their e-Commerce Gateway capabilities and launch online shops. Tutorial web pages \\r\\nwere launched in Estonia and Latvia to educate customers further and to give them useful guidance about building online shops. \\r\\n\\r\\nTablets were provided to seven families in Lithuania through Save the Children programme in order to support home schooling and \\r\\nremote studying. \\r\\n\\r\\nEFFORTS TO PREVENT FINANCIAL CRIME  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor remains vigilant about financial crime and is committed to preventing and detecting it. We regularly review our anti-financial \\r\\ncrime (AFC) practices and invest in the human and technological resources that are needed. We constantly work to get a better \\r\\nunderstanding of our customers and their transactions, and to manage and report any potential financial crime risk. Luminor \\r\\npredominantly serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers who have a strong personal or business connection \\r\\nto the Baltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, Luminor further enhanced its financial crime risk management framework in order to prevent, \\r\\ndetect, manage and report potential financial crime risk even better, and this has been supported by its conservative approach \\r\\ntowards money laundering and financial crime. The framework covers the technology, policies and procedures employed to detect \\r\\nfinancial crime, assess risks, run training and awareness-raising, and monitor new and developing financial crime risks continuously.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is subject to a wide range of legal requirements, and so we are transparent in all our activities and we work closely with all \\r\\nthe supervisory and regulatory authorities. Luminor also follows the international guidelines, recommendations and standards issued \\r\\nby the regulatory and supervisory authorities, international bodies, local banking associations, and by the financial intelligence units \\r\\nin each Baltic state.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to invest in systems and processes so we can adapt in a constantly changing environment - an example is that full \\r\\ndomestic payment screening was introduced in the second quarter of 2020. The bank is further developing its common monitoring \\r\\nand screening solution in all three Baltic states and has envisaged several further developments that will be delivered during 2020 \\r\\nand the first half of 2021. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor considers that work to raise awareness is an important component of the financial crime risk management framework. In \\r\\nthe second quarter, 34 training events related to AFC and corporate compliance areas were held on 18 different topics. \\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER EVENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Estonian Financial Supervision and Resolution Authority (the FSA)in June 2020 published its ruling on the misdemeanour \\r\\nproceedings against Luminor Pension Estonia AS. The FSA stated that the information published in 2019 in the Key Investor \\r\\nInformation Documents by Luminor Pensions Estonia AS about the ongoing charges for managed pension funds was incomplete, and \\r\\nso it set a penalty of 170 000 EUR. Luminor Pensions Estonia AS had already published the corrected information to its customers in \\r\\nFebruary 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Shareholders Meeting of Luminor Bank AS in June 2020 appointed Maria Elena Cappello as a new member of the bank’s \\r\\nSupervisory Council. \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 30 JUNE \\r\\n\\r\\nJohan Pedersson Lilliehöök has resigned from the Supervisory Council of Luminor Bank AS as of 1 August 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 10  \\r\\n\\r\\n  Financial results \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit in the second quarter was 13.5 million EUR, which is 6.8 million EUR more than in the same quarter of last year. The loan-\\r\\nto-deposit ratio came down to 93.0% from 117.1% a year earlier. It was supported both by an increase of 1.0 billion EUR in deposits \\r\\nand a decrease of 1.4 billion EUR in lending portfolio.  \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income was 55.9 million EUR in the second quarter having been 67.0 million EUR in the same quarter last year, (please, \\r\\nrefer to additional information at Note 1) and this decline is explained by the planned effort to reprice and rightsize the balance sheet. \\r\\nNet commission income was 24% less than in the same quarter of last year, mainly because customer activity was lower as a \\r\\nconsequence of COVID-19. The lower level of customer activity was visible in the reduced number of transactions and volumes during \\r\\nthe lockdown period, but customer activity recovered at the end of the quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses in the second quarter were 64.8 million EUR, which is 3.9 million EUR less than a year earlier (please, refer \\r\\nto additional information at Note 1). Exceptional costs in the second quarter reached 23.5 million EUR, which is 18% more than the \\r\\ncomparable exceptional costs for the same period last year*. The largest part of the exceptional costs in the second quarter of this \\r\\nyear were IT expenses, which constituted 85% of them, while staff costs constituted another 11%. Total operating expenses excluding \\r\\nexceptional costs were 15% lower in the second quarter than in the same period last year. The underlying business performance \\r\\ncontinues to improve, which is reflected in improved cost-to-income ratio and return on equity excluding exceptional costs. Cost-to-\\r\\nincome ratio excluding exceptional costs decreased from 54.6% in the second quarter last year to 51.3% this year (6 month result was \\r\\n55.2% in 2019 and 51.1% in 2020) and return on equity excluding exceptional costs increased from 5.3% in the second quarter last \\r\\nyear to 9.2% this year (6 month result was 8.2% in 2019 and 5.7% in 2020, explained by loan loss provisions in the first quarter this \\r\\nyear as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic). \\r\\n\\r\\n*The comparable exceptional cost for the first quarter 2020 was 30.7 million EUR, and it was 19.8 million EUR in the first quarter 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nKey figures and ratios of Luminor**   \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\nQ2 Q1  Q2  January - June Full Year       \\r\\n\\r\\n2020 2020 2019 2020 2019 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit 13 463 -21 192 6 711 -7 729 33 078 53 997 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity 1 616 621 1 621 160 1 718 147 1 627 731 1 705 734 1 714 685 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE), % 3.3 -5.3 1.6 -1.0 3.9 3.1 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets \\r\\n13 357 895 \\r\\n\\r\\n13 492 \\r\\n719 14 081 334 13 603 840 14 662 559 14 522 261 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA), % 0.4 -0.6 0.2 -0.1 0.5 0.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 55 878 54 080 66 950 111 685 132 155 244 167 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets \\r\\n13 080 712 \\r\\n\\r\\n13 194 \\r\\n251 13 315 122 13 307 405 14 313 703 14 192 831 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM), % 1.7 1.6 2.0 1.7 1.9 1.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio (C/I), % 80.5 89.0 77.0 84.8 77.1 77.6 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio, %*** 0.13 1.05 0.38 0.60 0.06 0.22 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 9 616 727 9 927 897 10 979 181 9 616 727 10 979 181 10 222 547 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 10 344 572 9 958 280 9 374 812 10 344 572 9 374 812 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio, % 93.0 99.7 117.1 93.0 117.1 99.9 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET1 ratio, % 22.0 20.5 18.0 22.0 18.0 19.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio (gross), % 4.0 3.9 4.3 4.0 4.3 3.8 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income / Loans, % 2.3 2.2 2.4 2.3 2.4 2.4 \\r\\n\\r\\n** Quarterly ratios (ROE, ROA, NIM, C/I, Credit impairment ratio) are expressed on an annualised basis \\r\\n\\r\\n*** If loan recoveries prevail, the ratio is negative \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 11  \\r\\n\\r\\nExplanations  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity (belonging to the owners of the company) = (equity at the end of the reporting period + equity at the end of the previous period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) = Net profit / Average equity * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets = (assets at the end of the reporting period + assets at the end of the previous period) / 2  \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) = Net profit / Average assets * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets = (interest-earning assets at the end of the reporting period + interest-earning assets at the end of the previous period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) = Net interest income / Average interest earning assets * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio = Total operating expenses / Net total operating income * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio = Net losses or reversal on loans to customers / Net loans, average * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio = Loans to customers / Deposits from customers * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio = Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-weighted Assets \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL (non-performing loan) ratio = Gross impaired loans (Stage 3 loans) / Gross loans * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLENDING AND DEPOSITS  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lending portfolio continued to decrease and it was down to 9.6 billion EUR at the end of the second quarter from 11.0 billion EUR \\r\\na year earlier.

The composition changed slightly over the year as the share of deposits from the public sector increased from 17% \\r\\nto 21% and the share of deposits from business customers declined from 39% to 36% at the Baltic level. Luminor’s share of the deposit \\r\\nmarket in the Baltics decreased from 16.7% to 15.6% over the 12 months. \\r\\n\\r\\nASSET QUALITY FOR Q2 2020   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe adverse impact of COVID-19 had also affected asset quality at Luminor.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe severest impact was felt by industries like accommodation, tourism and aviation. Luminor’s exposure towards these economic \\r\\nsectors is relatively small, but the trends were also negative in the overall portfolio as other industries were hit quite severely as well. \\r\\nAs a result, requests for modifications including grace periods reached 1.1 billion EUR at the end of June 2020, covering 12% of the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 12  \\r\\n\\r\\ntotal credit portfolio. The flow of modification requests stabilised throughout May however, and was insignificant in June. The total \\r\\nvalue of modifications approved reached almost 1.0 billion EUR at the end of June 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 70% of the requests for modifications came from business customers. The reasons why business customers applied \\r\\nfor modifications earlier than individual customers did, might be that: \\r\\n\\r\\n• business customers were affected first; moreover, professional financial management leads business customers to \\r\\napproach their bank immediately, if they foresee a need for modifications;  \\r\\n\\r\\n• individual customers can often access unemployment benefits. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest part of the requests from business customers for modifications came from industries like real estate activities, \\r\\ntransportation and storage, wholesale and retail trade, and manufacturing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common modification requested was a grace period on principal payments. Luminor allows a full grace period covering both \\r\\nprincipal and interest payments in exceptional cases only.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe volume of overdue loans is fluctuating and not yet showing any clear negative trends, however, depending on the development \\r\\nof the pandemic and measures taken by governments, this might accelerate significantly during the second half of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s loan loss provisions reached 3.2 million EUR during the second quarter. Around two thirds of the loan loss provisions were \\r\\nfor Stage 3 exposures, while the rest were for Stage 1 and Stage 2. Stage 1 and Stage 2 loan loss provisions mainly increased because \\r\\nof changes in the macroeconomic outlook and downgrades. Stage 3 loan loss provisions were largely driven by forbearance measures \\r\\napplied to mortgage loans that triggered non-performing status. Loan loss provisions for the first quarter were 26.4 million EUR, \\r\\nbringing the total for the first half of 2020 to 29.6 million EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe share of non-performing loans, or the NPL ratio, was 4.0% at the end of the quarter, which is an increase of 0.1 percentage point \\r\\nfrom the previous quarter and was due to a decline in the total portfolio. The NPL ratio for the mortgage loan portfolio was 3.0%, \\r\\nwhich is an increase of 0.1 percentage point that was mainly due to the forbearance measures that were applied. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal allowance for expected credit losseson the balance sheet were 191.9 million EUR at the end of the quarter, of which 137.1 \\r\\nmillion EUR were for Stage 3 exposures. Non-performing loans totalled 393.8 million EUR at the end of second quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n

A key requirement for achieving this is \\r\\nthat the funding from former parents provided in equal parts by DNB and Nordea should gradually be replaced by other forms of \\r\\nfunding such as deposits and wholesale funding from third parties. As at the end of June 2020 Luminor was a fully self-funded banking \\r\\ngroup with zero outstanding funding from former parent banks under the debt facility agreement. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis has been achieved over time through reduced lending volumes and also through an improved funding structure. Deposits from \\r\\ncustomers stood at 10 344 million EUR at the end of the second quarter of 2020, and at 9 959 million EUR at the end of the first \\r\\nquarter. In March 2020 Luminor issued its inaugural five-year covered bond for 500 million EUR, which received a long-term rating of \\r\\nAa1 from Moody’s. The total nominal value of the bonds outstanding under the Euro Medium Term Note or EMTN programme was \\r\\n1 150 million EUR at the end of the second quarter of 2020 as Luminor had 650 million EUR of senior unsecured bonds outstanding. \\r\\nThe senior unsecured bonds issued under the EMTN programme have been assigned a rating of Baa2 by Moody’s. There were no new \\r\\nissuances during the second quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a committed funding facility agreement with its former parent banks that is provided in the form of a syndicate, with \\r\\neach partner in the syndicate providing 50% of the funding. At the end of the second quarter of 2020 the total facility stood at 2 337 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 17  \\r\\n\\r\\nmillion EUR and was fully unused, while at the end of the first quarter Luminor had used 150 million EUR of the credit line. The amount \\r\\nof the facility has been committed for five years from 1 October 2019, with an initial commitment for three years and the option for \\r\\nLuminor to extend it by up to two years, and it can be drawn with maturities of one, two or three years. The facility is partly secured, \\r\\nas Luminor had assigned mortgage loans to it with a carrying value of 1 667 million EUR at the end of the second quarter of 2020 and \\r\\nof 1 762 million EUR at the end of the first quarter. The total commitment was reduced by 700 million EUR in July 2020 to 1 637 million \\r\\nEUR following a voluntary cancellation by Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nStructure of Liabilities and Equity: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 April 2020 Luminor received its minimum own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) requirement in a decision of the Single \\r\\nResolution Board (the SRB) dated on 20 December 2019 that was executed for Luminor by a decision of  the Estonian Financial \\r\\nSupervision and Resolution Authority, dated on 1 April 2020. The MREL decision sets the following MREL requirements for Luminor: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Holding AS (the parent company of Luminor Bank AS) shall comply with the MREL at the consolidated level of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS of 17.28% of total liabilities and own funds at all times, and 11.97% of total liabilities and own funds shall be \\r\\nmet with subordinated instruments; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Holding AS shall have a transitional period until 30 June 2022 to comply with these requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at the end of the second quarter of 2020 the total MREL ratio stood at 16.6% at the consolidated level of Luminor Bank AS, down \\r\\nfrom 17% as at the end of the first quarter, while 11.8% of total liabilities and own funds were subordinated instruments as at the end \\r\\nof the second quarter of 2020 and 12.1% as at the end of the first quarter. It should be noted that the MREL requirements were set \\r\\nusing data as of 31 March 2019, which means the decision does not consider any subsequent events. \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, \\r\\nwith a stable outlook. There have been no changes to Luminor’s ratings since then. On 25 March 2020 Moody’s issued an updated \\r\\ncredit opinion for Luminor.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 March 2020 Moody’s assigned a definitive Aa1 rating to the mortgage covered bonds issued by Luminor Bank AS under the \\r\\nEstonian Covered Bonds Act. \\r\\n\\r\\n  LIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s structural liquidity risk is conservative and well-balanced, and it is based on metrics that measure liquidity risk and is \\r\\nappropriately adapted to the current economic and regulatory environment. Luminor uses a range of metrics to measure liquidity \\r\\nrisk, one of which is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The LCR for Luminor was 159% as at the end of the second quarter of 2020 \\r\\nand 144% as at the end of the first quarter under the definition of the LCR given in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). The \\r\\nratio increased as liquidity increased because lending volumes were lower. The liquidity buffer is composed of highly liquid central-\\r\\n\\r\\n345\\r\\n\\r\\n4 095 4 048\\r\\n\\r\\n2 201\\r\\n\\r\\n1157\\r\\n1623\\r\\n\\r\\nAll other Liabilities Corporate deposits Retail deposits Public sector\\r\\ndeposit s\\r\\n\\r\\nDebt  securities\\r\\nissued\\r\\n\\r\\nEquity\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 18  \\r\\n\\r\\nbank-eligible securities and cash. Long-term liquidity risk is measured as the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). Luminor’s NSFR rose to \\r\\n133% during the second quarter of 2020 from 126% at the end of the first quarter. It increased mainly because lending volumes were \\r\\nreduced and beneficial changes occurred in the structure of deposits that moved it towards more stable deposits. \\r\\n\\r\\n Q2  2020 Q1  2020 Q4  2019 Q3 2019 Q2  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 159.0% 143.7% 149.8% 144.3% 132.5% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR 133.2% 126.0% 123.0% 118.0% 127.4% \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are predominantly from residents of the Baltics.

Risk Exposure Amount (REA) has decreased to 7.2 billion EUR \\r\\nprimarily due to decrease of corporate exposures and the implementation of adjusted SME supporting factor. As at the end of the \\r\\nsecond quarter of 2020 Luminor had 1 587 million EUR in own funds and they were fully composed of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) \\r\\ncapital, meaning the Tier 1 and total capital ratios of Luminor stood at the same level as the CET1 ratio.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with the CRR, was 11.2% as at the end of the second quarter of 2020. The leverage ratio \\r\\nis calculated as total Tier 1 own funds divided by the total risk exposure measure, including the risk position on assets and off-balance-\\r\\nsheet liabilities. \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital ratios  \\r\\n\\r\\nPosition Q2  2020 Q1  2020 Q4  2019 Q3 2019 Q2  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeverage ratio 11.23% 11.46% 10.88% 10.89% 10.59% \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio 22.04% 20.54% 19.66% 18.73% 17.99% \\r\\n\\r\\nT1 capital ratio 22.04% 20.54% 19.66%   18.73% 17.99% \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal capital ratio 22.04% 20.54% 19.66% 18.73% 17.99% \\r\\n\\r\\n0.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.9%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.3% 1.3%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.3%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.4% 0.4%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.3%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.3%0.7%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.5%\\r\\n\\r\\nBaltic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOther EU Non-EU \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 19  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe prudential requirements, which are the Pillar 2 requirement set by the ECB in the 2019 Joint Decision on Capital, and the Systemic \\r\\nRisk Buffer and Countercyclical Risk Buffer requirements set by the Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian Supervisory Authorities, obliged \\r\\nLuminor to hold capital exceeding 10.1% of CET1 and 14.5% of Total Capital as at 30 June 2020.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE INFORMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) is a local credit institution whose parent company is Luminor Holding AS that is \\r\\nultimately controlled by BCP VII, an investment fund managed by an affiliate of Blackstone Group Inc. Other shareholders of Luminor \\r\\nHolding AS - Nordea Bank Abp and DNB BANK ASA - are considered to be the entities with significant influence over the Group. The \\r\\nLuminor Bank’s registered legal address is Liivalaia 45, 10145, Tallinn, Republic of Estonia. \\r\\n\\r\\nNew company Luminor Holding AS, established on the 14th of May 2019, is the new parent company of Luminor Bank AS since 23 \\r\\nSeptember 2019. Until 23 September 2019 the parent company was Luminor Group AB. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor Bank AS has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries through \\r\\nthe Estonian registered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone acquired a 60.1% majority stake in the Luminor \\r\\nHolding AS, the owner of Luminor Bank AS. Luminor Bank AS previous owners, Nordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB BANK ASA \\r\\n(\"DNB\"), each retained a 19.95% equity stake in the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current interim report, “Bank” (or Luminor Bank AS) refers to Luminor Bank AS. “Group” refers to the consolidated financial \\r\\nstatements of Luminor Bank AS and its subsidiaries.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 June 2020 Luminor Bank AS directly or indirectly owned majority in the following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\nRepublic of Estonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\nRepublic of Latvia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\nRepublic of Lithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Liising AS \\r\\n• Luminor Pensions Estonia AS\\r\\n• Promano Estonia OÜ\\r\\n\\r\\n• Luminor Asset Management IPAS\\r\\n• Luminor Finance SIA\\r\\n• Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS\\r\\n• Luminor Līzings SIA\\r\\n• Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA\\r\\n• Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n• Realm SIA\\r\\n• Salvus SIA\\r\\n• Salvus 2 SIA\\r\\n• Salvus 3 SIA\\r\\n• Salvus 4 SIA\\r\\n• Salvus 6 SIA \\r\\n• Trioleta SIA\\r\\n• Baltic ipasums SIA\\r\\n\\r\\n• Industrius UAB (under\\r\\nliquidation)\\r\\n\\r\\n• Intractus UAB\\r\\n• Promano Lit UAB (under\\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation)\\r\\n• Recurso UAB (under\\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation)\\r\\n• Luminor Investiciju \\r\\n\\r\\nValdymas UAB\\r\\n• Luminor Lizingas UAB\\r\\n• Gėlužės projektai UAB\\r\\n\\r\\n(under liquidation)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 June 2020 Luminor Bank AS had ownership in the following associated companies: \\r\\n• ALD Automotive AS (25%)\\r\\n• ALD Automotive SIA (25%)\\r\\n• ALD Automotive UAB (25%)\\r\\n• SIA Kredītinformācijas Birojs (22,61%) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n28 \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) was prepared in \\r\\naccordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed consolidated interim financial \\r\\ninformation does not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in \\r\\nconjunction with the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are consistent with \\r\\nthose followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, except \\r\\nfor the adoption of new standards effective as of 1 January 2020. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or \\r\\namendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. Several amendments and interpretations apply for the first time in 2020, but \\r\\ndo not have a material impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS Interpretation Committee agenda decision regarding deferred tax related to investments in subsidiaries \\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Estonia and Latvia have replaced the traditional profit-based tax regimes with distribution-based tax regimes where corporate \\r\\nincome tax is not payable on profit but rather on distribution of dividends. In accordance with IAS 12.52A and 57A, in distribution-based \\r\\ntax regimes no current or deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of undistributed profits until a liability to pay dividends is \\r\\nrecognised. As a market practice in Estonia, this accounting policy has been applied consistently to all undistributed profits in the group, \\r\\nregardless of whether those profits accumulated in the parent or in the subsidiaries. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2020, IFRS Interpretation Committee made an agenda decision where it concluded that the principle set out in IAS 12.52A and \\r\\n57A only applies to undistributed profits accumulated in the parent company and does not apply to undistributed profits accumulated \\r\\nin the subsidiaries. Instead, the principles described in IAS 12.39-40 should be followed in respect of undistributed profits in subsidiaries, \\r\\nstipulating that a deferred tax shall be recognized in respect of such accumulated profits, unless it is probable that they will not be \\r\\ndistributed to the parent in the foreseeable future. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is currently assessing the potential impact of the IFRS Interpretation Committee agenda decision on its financial statements \\r\\nand will reflect the impact, if any, in its 2020 annual financial statements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group presents financial information in interim report in the same format as it was presented in the annual financial statements \\r\\nof Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019, except for several changes in classification within the Consolidated \\r\\nstatement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as described below. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n29 \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in presentation \\r\\n\\r\\nContent of statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income has been reviewed for the Interm Report.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and applies assumptions that affect the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements and \\r\\nthe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s \\r\\nexperience and expectations of future events. In the first half of 2020, COVID-19 pandemic affected many economies, individuals and \\r\\ncompanies and thus also required Luminor to react and make certain judgements which inter alia had the effect on the impairment \\r\\namounts. \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognizes credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The Standard applies a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) \\r\\napproach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n30 \\r\\n\\r\\nfair value through profit or loss (FVPL), together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The assets to test for \\r\\nimpairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes assets where there has been \\r\\nno significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or which are classified as low credit risk (credit rating indicating investment \\r\\ngrade). The allowances for stage 1 assets are based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default in the next \\r\\ntwelve months (12-month expected credit loss). Stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk. The \\r\\nallowances for stage 2 assets are based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default over the life of the asset \\r\\n(lifetime expected credit losses). Stage 3 includes credit-impaired (defaulted) assets, and the allowances reflect the lifetime expected \\r\\ncredit losses. Material assets in stage 3 are tested for impairment on an individual basis, while for immaterial stage 3 assets a collective \\r\\nassessment is performed. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for an additional category - \\r\\npurchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) - regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable \\r\\ninputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include: \\r\\n\\r\\n• evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2; identification\\r\\nof unlikely to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3;\\r\\n\\r\\n• classification of forbearance and Watch list;\\r\\n• assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including the\\r\\n\\r\\nvarious formulas and the choice of inputs;\\r\\n• the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and \\r\\n\\r\\nexposure at default (EAD);\\r\\n• determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;\\r\\n• estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic and\\r\\n\\r\\npessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;\\r\\n• estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and assigning\\r\\n\\r\\nprobabilities to those scenarios;\\r\\n• setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe model applied (including triggers for significant increase in credit risk) was not changed in the first half of 2020. The macroeconomic \\r\\nparameters were reviewed to reflect the outlook due to COVID-19.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMore qualitative and quantitative information on an impairment of financial assets in light of COVID-19 is provided in Note 3 General \\r\\nRisk Management Policies. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from \\r\\nactive markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The input to \\r\\nthese models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in \\r\\nestablishing fair values. For the fair value of financial assets and liabilities refer to Note 17. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES\\r\\n\\r\\nThe information where no major changes have been implemented during first half of year 2020 is not disclosed in this interim financial \\r\\nstatements and can be found in the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements as at 31 December 2019. The interim financial \\r\\nstatements discloses information on changes directly initiated as part of the bank’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and aditional \\r\\ninformation about changes implemented during the reporting period not directly related to COVID-19 pandemic in further sections of \\r\\nthis note. \\r\\n\\r\\nMAIN GOALS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of risk management at Luminor is to achieve an optimal balance between the risk of losses and the earnings potential in a \\r\\nmedium- and long-term perspective.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s Risk Management function is organised in order to ensure efficient and effective risk management and full implementation \\r\\nof the principles and requirements outlined in Luminor’s Risk Policy and Strategy. The Risk Division is a structural unit of Luminor, which \\r\\nexecutes risk management function and reports to the Group Chief Risk Officer. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n31 \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the light of COVID-19 pandemic developments in Europe, the ECB-led Comprehensive Assessment (i.e. both the Asset Quality Review \\r\\nand Stress Test exercises) has been put on hold until further notice. Revised dates or timelines have not been disclosed yet. Luminor \\r\\ncontinues to focus on a COVID-19 impact assessment and has performed institution-wide stress tests under COVID-19 macroeconomic \\r\\nscenarios and financial shocks. These scenarios are updated on an ongoing basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of the ongoing revision of tasks performed within the risk management function as well as to further facilitate the use of \\r\\nsynergies between departments, the Risk Division will be reorganized as of 1st of July 2020. The reorganization focuses on two main \\r\\ngoals. The first goal is to establish a clear split of responsibilities between the First and Second Line of Defense in regard to Market & \\r\\nLiquidity Risk Management. The second goal is to significantly enhance synergies in the Risk Division by merging most of data and \\r\\nmodelling related activities into one central department. The new organisational chart can be seen below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Enterprise Risk Department is a centralized centre of expertise and manages risk management tools and processes which run across \\r\\ndifferent risk types. The control function for operational risk lies under the responsibility of the Operational Risk Department. The \\r\\nMarket & Liquidity Risk Department is responsible for market risk and liquidity risk control. The First Line of Defence tasks previously \\r\\nperformed by the Market & Liquidity Risk Department were extracted into the Market & Treasury Middle Office, which is planned to \\r\\nbe moved out of the Risk Division to the First Line of Defence. The control function for credit risk is under the responsibility of the Credit \\r\\nRisk Department. The newly established Risk Data & Analytics Department combines now most of the activities related to data and \\r\\nmodelling. The Model Risk & Validation Department owns the model risk framework and respective validation activities. The Special \\r\\nProjects Department is newly set up to directly support the CRO on various ad-hoc projects and tasks. The Risk Division is part of the \\r\\nSecond Line of Defence and the organisational departments within the Risk Division report directly to the Group Chief Risk Officer \\r\\n(CRO).  \\r\\n\\r\\nCREDIT RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures imposed by most of the European countries had an adverse impact on the \\r\\neconomies in the first half of 2020. In particular the social- and economic constraints imposed by the governments across Europe and \\r\\nalso in the Baltic states implied a significant reduction of economic activity, including businesses being almost entirely shut down in \\r\\ncertain sectors, and increasing unemployment as a consequence. Since Luminor is one of the largest banks in the Baltic region, many \\r\\nof Luminor’s customers are directly or indirectly affected by this situation. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has been monitoring the spread of COVID-19 since early 2020 and has adjusted its risk management to the new operating \\r\\nenvironment. Luminor is further aware of its important role for the Baltic economies and communities and thus chose to be as \\r\\nconstructive as possible in its support towards customers early on and throughout the crisis. On the other hand, Luminor is also charged \\r\\nwith the responsibility to protect its depositors, and to make sure that Luminor’s balance sheet and the Baltic financial system do not \\r\\nbecome overburdened by companies for which there is no viable business model after the crisis. Unfortunately, some customers need \\r\\nto be significantly restructured due to the COVID-19 induced economic crisis, and in cases where even that is no longer feasible, some \\r\\nbusinesses might have to be wound down in an orderly manner. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania have joined the industry-wide private moratoria initiatives in each \\r\\ncountry, which comply with the European Banking Authority’s (the EBA) Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria on loan \\r\\nrepayments applied in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The moratoria are applicable for performing COVID-19 affected customers \\r\\nexperiencing temporarily financial difficulties, yet had acceptable payment discipline during 12 months leading up to the crisis. The \\r\\nterms of postponements are the following:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• for individual customers, a grace period on principal payments might be granted up to 12 months for mortgage loans and up to \\r\\n6 months for consumer credits and leasing agreements;\\r\\n\\r\\n• for business customers with an exposure below 5 million EUR, the period of payment postponement is up to 6 months for\\r\\namortising products.\\r\\n\\r\\nGroup Chief Risk Officer\\r\\n\\r\\nEnterprise Risk Operational Risk Market & Liquidity Risk Credit Risk\\r\\nRisk Data & \\r\\n\\r\\nAnalytics\\r\\n\\r\\nModel Risk & \\r\\nInternal \\r\\n\\r\\nValidation\\r\\nSpecial   Projects\\r\\n\\r\\nMarkets & \\r\\nTreasury Middle \\r\\n\\r\\nOffice\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n32 \\r\\n\\r\\nModification gains/losses were immaterial for 3 and 6 months 2020 period. In total Luminor prolonged 15% (volume) of corporate loan \\r\\nportfolio and leasing’s by 3-6 months, 8% mortgages by 6 months and 3% private other loans and leasing. \\r\\n\\r\\nAny other conditions shall not be changed, and the grace period can be granted only once. The moratoria remain in force until the \\r\\ndeadline set by the EBA; originally by 30 June 2020, currently extended until 30 September 2020. The modifications under the moratoria \\r\\nare not classified as forbearance if no other SICR indicators are present. For the cases not meeting moratoria conditions, an individual \\r\\nassessment is performed. \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment policies \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor recognises credit losses in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 applies a forward-looking expected credit loss \\r\\n(ECL) approach. For more detailed information on the impairment policies, please refer to the Note 5 General Risk Management Policies \\r\\nof the Luminor Bank AS Annual Report 2019. In the first half of 2020 the impairment methodology remained unchanged. \\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent authorities – the ECB, the EBA, the European Securities and Markets Authority (the ESMA), the IFRS Foundation, the Basel \\r\\nCommittee on Banking Supervision (the BCBS) – have announced various measures to deal with the crisis and minimise the effect on \\r\\nthe economies. Luminor acts in line with the above mentioned institutions’ guidance. The modifications granted for COVID-19 affected \\r\\ncustomers do not automatically indicate Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR), nor a classification to forbearance or default status. \\r\\nHowever, Luminor’s obligation to assess for unlikeliness to pay (which consequently triggers default status) remains in place. \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the ECB guidance, excessively procyclical forecasts of macroeconomic variables were avoided in the first half of 2020. \\r\\nLuminor’s macroeconomists updated the forecasts of macroeconomic variables used in the PD and LGD modelling at the end of the \\r\\nsecond quarter of 2020 with projections and assumptions over three years, assuming not only the nearest short-term downturn, but \\r\\nalso the recovery period in the market after that. Starting from the fourth year it is assumed that risk parameters (PD and LGD) converge \\r\\nto their long-term average levels (estimated over the cycle).  \\r\\n\\r\\n30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic \\r\\nvariables \\r\\n\\r\\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 (Baseline) Scenario 3 \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for \\r\\nscenario, % \\r\\n\\r\\n30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in \\r\\nreal GDP, % \\r\\n\\r\\n4.3 -6.7 5.7 5.4 3.4 -8.1 6.0 6.8 3.1 -11.7 2.9 6.4 4.2 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment \\r\\nrate, % \\r\\n\\r\\n4.4 7.7 7.5 5.5 5.1 10.2 9.1 6.5 5.7 10.8 12.8 9.8 8.5 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of \\r\\nresidential real \\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n\\r\\n7.0 -2.0 0.1 4.5 5.6 -2.0 0.1 4.5 5.6 -6.2 -6.5 3.5 4.9 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n33 \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvia \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic \\r\\nvariables \\r\\n\\r\\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 (Baseline) Scenario 3 \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for \\r\\nscenario, % \\r\\n\\r\\n30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in \\r\\nreal GDP, % \\r\\n\\r\\n2.2 -4.8 5.9 5.2 3.0 -7.5 6.3 5.4 3.3 -9.4 2.9 5.5 4.6 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment \\r\\nrate, % \\r\\n\\r\\n6.3 8.6 7.3 6.4 6.2 9.5 9.0 7.6 6.7 10.9 11.8 9.0 7.5 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of \\r\\nresidential real \\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n\\r\\n9.0 2.2 0.5 8.4 5.5 -0.4 -5.0 6.1 5.1 -2.2 -11.3 3.9 6.5 \\r\\n\\r\\nLithuania \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic \\r\\nvariables \\r\\n\\r\\nScenario 1 Scenario 2 (Baseline) Scenario 3 \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F 2020F 2021F 2022F 2023F \\r\\n\\r\\nProbability for \\r\\nscenario, % \\r\\n\\r\\n30% 60% 10% \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change in real \\r\\nGDP, % \\r\\n\\r\\n3.9 -5.1 8.3 4.8 3.5 -6.4 6.0 5.3 3.1 -9.5 3.2 4.9 2.6 \\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment rate, \\r\\n% \\r\\n\\r\\n6.3 8.2 7.7 6.6 6.2 9.6 9.3 7.6 6.7 10.8 12.3 10.7 8.8 \\r\\n\\r\\nAnnual change of \\r\\nresidential real \\r\\nestate price, % \\r\\n\\r\\n6.8 1.8 4.3 7.0 6.0 -1.5 -1.5 6.8 5.0 -4.8 -8.5 2.5 4.0 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n34 \\r\\n\\r\\nGross amount and expected credit loss allowance amount for loans and leases as at 30 June 2020 and 31 December 2019 are disclosed \\r\\nin the tables below: \\r\\n\\r\\n30 June 2020  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR  \\r\\nNote Gross \\r\\n\\r\\nAllowance for \\r\\nexpected credit \\r\\n\\r\\nlosses \\r\\nNet \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from banks and other credit institutions 9 99 216 -22 99 194 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial institutions 11 13 188 -185 13 003 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic sector  11 148 915 -32 148 883 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Business customers  11 4 093 412 -115 310 3 978 102 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans  2 950 778 -96 077 2 854 701 \\r\\n\\r\\nFactoring  184 086 -2 058 182 028 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing 958 548 -17 175 941 373 \\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual customers 11 5 553 118 -76 379 5 476 739 \\r\\n\\r\\nMortgage loans 4 636 952 -57 682 4 579 270 \\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer and card loans 121 883 -1 487 120 396 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther loans 309 748 -12 936 296 812 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing 484 535 -4 274 480 261 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 9 907 849 -191 928 9 715 921 \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\nNote Gross \\r\\n\\r\\nAllowance for \\r\\nexpected credit \\r\\n\\r\\nlosses \\r\\nNet \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from banks and other credit institutions 9 141 654 -9 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial institutions 11 29 378 -123 29 255 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic sector 11 174 732 -17 174 715 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Business customers  11 4 523 201 -111 037 4 412 164 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans  3 156 365 -95 544 3 060 821 \\r\\n\\r\\nFactoring  278 511 -1 691 276 820 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing 1 088 325 -13 802 1 074 523 \\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual customers 11 5 680 911 -74 498 5 606 413 \\r\\n\\r\\nMortgage loans 4 689 319 -56 080 4 633 239 \\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer and card loans 132 862 -1 452 131 410 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther loans 325 119 -11 938 313 181 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing 533 611 -5 028 528 583 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 10 549 876 -185 684 10 364 192 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe credit quality of loans to customers as at 30 June 2020 and 31 December 2019 are disclosed in the tables below according to the \\r\\ninternal risk scale for performing customers: probability of default for low risk rating grades (1 to 4) is in the range from 0.00% to 0.75%, \\r\\nfor moderate risk rating grades (5 to 7) it is from 0.75% to 3.00%, for high risk rating grades (from 8 to 10) it is from 3.00% to 40.00%.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe portfolio distribution as at 30 June 2020 shows an increase in Stage 2 (mostly due to inclusion of customers in Watch-list and \\r\\ndowngrades) and slight increase in Stage 3 (inflow of new non-performing exposures slightly outweighs the outflow) compared to the \\r\\nend of year 2019.

The internal risk grade and \\r\\nprobability of default (PD) of banks is based on the available risk classifications from rating agencies Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and \\r\\nFitch.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Luminor a separate dedicated Financial Institutions unit acts as a single core competence center and ensures holistic overview of the \\r\\nGroup’s credit limits/exposure on banks and countries. Since March 2020, the Financial Institutions Department has switched from \\r\\nquarterly to daily portfolio monitoring. A Financial Institutions Credit Commitee is organised on a regular basis to follow-up the latest \\r\\nmarket developments and review if any changes/restrictions are needed for established credit limits towards banks and countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s portfolio consists of reputable investment grade correspondent banks that have not seen internal credit rating downgrades \\r\\nduring the second quarter of 2020, however some Nostro counterparts (3 banks) faced external rating downgrade by 1 notch from one \\r\\nof the three large rating agencies, mostly related to COVID-19 uncertainty or Parent downgrade (UniCredit Group).

Based on internal risk self-assessment, the most significant parts of the market risk for the Group are interest rate \\r\\nrisk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange risk, which all stayed well within internal Risk Appetite Framework and lower level limits, \\r\\nwhile the exposures where at the similar levels as they were in the last reporting quarter. The significance of other risks is lower, as the \\r\\nGroup does not have any open positions in equity instruments for trading, while all commodity deals with customers are hedged in the \\r\\nmarket with back-to-back transactions. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the major negative impact to the Group in terms of market risk could arise from \\r\\ncredit spread risk. This risk is mitigated by limits as well as certain quality requirements for the bond portfolios. The Bank follows a \\r\\nrigorous framework for debt securities management. Bond portfolios managed by Treasury and Asset and Liability Management and \\r\\nMarkets Departments are restricted in size, level of quality, region available and counterparty, limiting credit risk exposure. However, \\r\\nthe bank measures the stressed spread impact to its liquidity bond portfolio as part of the Risk Appetite Framework. Assuming a 100 \\r\\nbasis points spread widening towards risk-free alternative investments of matching maturity profile for A-rated bonds and a 50 basis \\r\\npoints spread widening for corresponding AA-rated bonds, the projected decrease in market value of the bonds would be the following: \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR 30 June 2020 31 March 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket value loss projection due to increase in credit spreads 7 850 6 523 \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations in time, the risk of incurring losses due to \\r\\nsudden decrease in financial resources (e.g. a financial crisis situation may result in a delay of incoming payments) or an increase of the \\r\\nprice of new resources for refinancing. The consequence of liquidity risk may be failure to meet obligations to repay depositors and \\r\\nfulfil loan commitments. The Group uses a range of liquidity metrics for measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk including \\r\\nthe Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), internal liquidity limits and trigger events, survival horizon \\r\\nmetric as part of liquidity stress testing. \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed to ensure a constant ability to settle contractual obligations. The Group has developed a set of early warning \\r\\nindicators for a timely identification of liquidity crises, and business and funding contingency plans to manage the Group’s liquidity \\r\\nduring market disruptions. The liquidity risk management strategy is reviewed at least annually or after any significant change in the \\r\\ninternal or external environment the Group operates in.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed across the three Lines of Defence: \\r\\n\\r\\n• The First Line of Defence comprises the Group’s Treasury and Asset and Liability Management (TALM) and the business areas.\\r\\nTALM is responsible for the daily liquidity management and funds transfer pricing (FTP). To ensure the funding in situations where\\r\\nLuminor is in urgent need of cash and the normal funding sources do not suffice, Luminor holds a liquidity buffer that consists of\\r\\ncentral bank cash and high quality securities that can be readily sold or used as collateral for funding operations;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Market and Liquidity Risk Department is the Second Line of Defence and is responsible for providing independent oversight and\\r\\ncontrol of liquidity risk and the First Line of Defence;\\r\\n\\r\\n• The Internal Audit function is the Third Line of Defence, which is responsible for providing independent assurance over the First\\r\\nand Second Lines of Defence activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk management has a focus on short term obligations and more structural long-term liquidity risk. Both short term and long-\\r\\nterm liquidity risks are measured and limited with different internal and external metrics.  The main metrics used to monitor liquidity \\r\\nrisk are LCR, NSFR and Surivival Horizon. The aim of intraday and short-term liquidity management is to meet the daily need for funds \\r\\nto ensure compliance with the reserve and liquidity requirements set by the ECB, as well as compliance with internal liquidity limits. \\r\\nShort-term liquidity is maintained through the daily monitoring of the liquidity status, day-to-day funding and trading the appropriate \\r\\nfinancial instruments for liquidity purposes. Long-term liquidity risk management is supported by analysing the estimated future cash \\r\\nflows considering deposit and loan portfolio growth, as well as possible refinancing sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of liquidity risk assessment, the liquidity gap is analysed considering the maturity of cash flows. The liquidity risk is \\r\\nrestricted by imposing internal limits on the liquidity gap. Utilisation of this limit is subject to regular monitoring and reporting to \\r\\nmanagement bodies in the Group. The liquidity gap is calculated by analysing the Group’s net refinancing situation within one week, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n41 \\r\\n\\r\\none month and three months applying a \"business as usual\" approach. Liquid assets and short-term liabilities are included in liquidity \\r\\ngap calculations for respective terms (1 week to 3 months). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe LCR is calculated as the ratio of a credit institution’s liquidity buffer to its net liquidity outflows over a 30-calendar-day stress period \\r\\nand is expressed as a percentage. The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of the Group’s liquidity risk profile and \\r\\nrequires the holding of risk-free assets that may be easily liquidated to meet required payments for outflows net of inflows during a \\r\\nthirty-day crisis period without support from the central bank. The minimum regulatory limit of LCR is set at 100%, however the Group \\r\\nhas a substantial buffer over it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is defined as the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable \\r\\nfunding over a one-year time horizon. The minimum requirement for NSFR is 100%, however the Group has a substantial buffer and \\r\\nmaintains a higher ratio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has set the limits in place for various measures, including LCR, NSFR, liquidity gaps, and manages those within the set limits \\r\\nby ensuring the proper maturity structure of its assets and liabilities, for example, via issuing long dated debt.

buffer and collateral management \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a contractual agreement for funding in place with shareholders DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank Abp. This strongly \\r\\nmitigates the likelihood of funding liquidity risk which may be caused by deposit run off, wholesale funding risk (roll over and new \\r\\nissuance), unexpected outflows from off-balance sheet obligations and legal risks (e.g. not being able to issue funding due to legal \\r\\nrestrictions). As the Group is moving towards more reliance on self-funding rather than on support from shareholders, other funding \\r\\nsources are being established or are already in place for diversifying the funding base. Luminor also relies on the stability of current \\r\\ncustomer deposits. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group is taking part in the ECB’s Eurosystem open market operations. In particular, the Group is a user of the ECB Targeted Long \\r\\nTerm Refinancing Operations (TLTRO). In addition, a significant part of funding is attracted through retail and corporate deposits. \\r\\nMoreover, the Group has already issued 650 million EUR of its own senior debt securities and 500 million EUR of covered bonds, and is \\r\\nconsidering to increase this amount in the future even more, which would further diversify the funding opportunities. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main part of the liquidity buffer is held with the Central Bank Accounts where the Group held 3.1 billion EUR at the end of June \\r\\n2020. This buffer can be utilized at any time when the need arises. \\r\\n\\r\\nSurvival horizon \\r\\n\\r\\nThe key metric for liquidity risk appetite set in the Risk Appetite Framework is the survival horizon analysed across different stress \\r\\nscenarios. The survival horizon is defined as a period with a positive cumulative cash flow. It is used to capture the liquidity buffer \\r\\navailable outright to be used in liquidity stress situations within 12 months. The outcome of liquidity stress testing is the number of \\r\\ndays the Group can withstand a liquidity crisis considering Luminor’s mitigating capacity, for example the liquidity buffer. \\r\\n\\r\\nThree different scenarios are considered while measuring survival horizon: bank-specific, market-wide and the combination of the most \\r\\nsevere assumptions from the previous two. Stress testing assumptions include but are not limited to severe deposit withdrawals, \\r\\nincluding early termination of term deposits and run-off of top 5 depositors, deterioration of financial assets, decrease of loan \\r\\nrepayment levels, increase of utilization of credit commitments, as well as limited availability of credit lines from shareholders based \\r\\non the existing Facility Agreement. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n46 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity buffer for the survival horizon metric is strongly affected by the assumption of outgoing deposits in the first few days and \\r\\nweeks of the turbulence period, with the smaller continuous run-off occurring in the following months. Due to rather high concentration \\r\\nof top depositors, the Group tests resistance towards a run-off of the 5 largest depositors as well. Total funds of the top 5 largest \\r\\ndepositors amounted to 1 287 million EUR at the end of the second quarter of 2020 compared to 1347 million EUR at the end of 2019. \\r\\nDespite that the Group has sufficient liquidity and can survive for longer than 1 year period without any additional support. On top of \\r\\nthat, Luminor has substantial unused credit line from shareholders which can be utilized at any time based on the mutual Facility \\r\\nAgreement. Furthermore, the majority of liquid buffer consists of cash held within central banks and highly liquid debt securities which \\r\\nsubstantially softens the consequences of deteriorating liquidity in case of high outflows.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s liquidity situation is sufficiently strong to survive severe external shocks. \\r\\n\\r\\nOPERATIONAL RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or external events. \\r\\nOperational risk in Luminor includes the following sub-risks: Legal risk, Compliance risk, Fraud and Financial Crime risk, Conduct risk, \\r\\nICT risk, Information Security risk, Data Management and Protection risk, People risk, Third Party/Outsourcing risk, Change/Project risk, \\r\\nProcess & Reporting risk and excludes Reputational risk and Business Model risk.    \\r\\n\\r\\nOperational risk management in Luminor is governed by the Operational Risk Policy and Subsidiary Governance Framework \\r\\ndocumentation. Each manager and process owner within the bank is responsible for the management of risks inherent in the activities \\r\\nand processes within their respective area. This includes fostering a sound risk culture in their respective reporting lines to ensure that \\r\\nemployees understand the operations that are performed by them, the risks inherent in these, and the importance of controls they \\r\\nexecute or oversee the execution of.   \\r\\n\\r\\nA key objective of the Operational Risk Department is to identify any deviations of Luminor’s operational risk profile from the desired \\r\\nrisk level that is stated in the Risk Appetite Framework, and to do so in a timely manner to ensure any deviations can be effectively \\r\\nmanaged without significant detriment to the bank, its customers or other stakeholders. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe second quarter of 2020 saw a stabilisation in operational risk management across Luminor following the outbreak of COVID-19 in \\r\\nthe first quarter of 2020. The crisis management committee stood down in May, and staff incrementally began to return to work in \\r\\nLuminor’s offices throughout the quarter, in accordance with relevant social distancing rules and precautions. None of Luminor’s \\r\\nbusiness processes or client services were significantly interrupted as a result of COVID-19, and the Bank’s management of the situation \\r\\nevidenced Luminor’s ability to operate under it’s business continuity plans during crisis conditions. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor management is kept updated on the status of operational risk through periodic and ad hoc risk reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s regulatory capital consists fully of Tier 1/Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Tier1/CET1 capital consists of ordinary shares, \\r\\nshare premium, mandatory reserve, retained earnings of the previous financial year, the audited profit of the current financial year and \\r\\nless the intangible assets, deferred tax assets, revaluation profit of investment properties, current year losses, if any, and other \\r\\ndeductions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital is calculated and allocated for risk coverage following the regulations in the CRD IV and CRR of the European Union and the \\r\\nlocal legal acts. The Group’s objectives in capital management are as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\n• consistency with Luminor Group’s long-term strategy (including meeting the risk appetite of the Group) and the Dividend policy;\\r\\n• the ability to pursue the business objectives;\\r\\n• fulfilment of both internal and external capitalisation targets (capital adequacy);\\r\\n• sufficient and proper composition of capital that would withstand stressful events.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital adequacy assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in accordance with the information guidelines for the risk \\r\\nmanagement and capital adequacy disclosure (Pillar 3) report. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n47 \\r\\n\\r\\nQuantitative information regarding the capital managed by the Group is presented below: \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the prudential requirements, the Pillar 2 requirement set by the ECB in the 2019 Joint Decision on Capital and the Systemic \\r\\nrisk and Countercyclical risk buffer requirements set by the Central Banks of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, Luminor Group is required \\r\\nto hold capital exceeding 10.1% CET1 and 14.5% Total capital. Total capital and CET1 capital requirements consist of the following \\r\\ncomponents: \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal capital CET1 \\r\\n\\r\\nMinimum Pillar 1 requirement 8.0 % 4.5 % \\r\\n\\r\\nPillar 2 requirement 2.0 % 1.1 % \\r\\n\\r\\nO-SII (other systemically important institution) buffer 2.0 % 2.0 % \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital conservation buffer 2.5 % 2.5 % \\r\\n\\r\\nSystemic risk buffer* 0.0 % 0.0 % \\r\\n\\r\\nCountercyclical buffer* 0.0 % 0.0 % \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal regulatory requirement 14.5 % 10.1 % \\r\\n\\r\\n* As response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the systemic risk buffer was set to 0% starting from 1 May 2020 and the countercyclical buffer was set to 0% \\r\\nstarting from 1 April 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Regulatory Requirements for Calculating the Minimum Capital Requirements, the Group shall provide own funds, which \\r\\nmust at all times exceed or equal the sum of the capital requirements for: \\r\\n\\r\\n• credit risk;\\r\\n• market risk;\\r\\n• operational risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn compliance with these regulations, the Group calculates the credit risk and market risk minimum capital requirements by using the \\r\\nStandardised approach. The Group does not apply any Value at Risk (VaR) or other internal models for the calculation of the market \\r\\nrisk capital requirement and applies the Basic Indicators Approach for calculating the operational risk capital requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\n thousand EUR 30 June 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nOWN FUNDS \\r\\n\\r\\n1.

Where observable market data is not available, \\r\\nexpert judgment is required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements, the above mentioned techniques \\r\\nrelated to unobservable inputs were not used as no such financial assets and liabilities exist on the statement of financial position of \\r\\nthe Group.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTISED COSTS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR  \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value \\r\\n\\r\\n30 June 2020 30 June 2020 31 December 2019 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortised cost \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 3 293 669  3 293 669  2 924 019  2 924 019  \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 99 194  99 194  141 645  141 645  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 9 616 727  9 198 746  10 222 547  10 324 772  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 13 009 590  12 591 609  13 288 211  13 390 436  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 103 124  103 124  980 692  980 692  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 10 344 572  10 344 572  10 235 443  10 235 443  \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 1 157 038  1 155 652  651 716  653 967  \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 61 597  61 597  45 303  45 303  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 11 666 331  11 664 945  11 913 154  11 915 405  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n56 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarises the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities. Financial \\r\\ninstruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the\\r\\nmeasurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and shall be used without\\r\\nadjustment to measure fair value whenever available;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 2 — valuation techniques for which inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 are observable for the asset\\r\\nor liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be\\r\\nobservable for a substantial part of the term of the asset or liability; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Level 3 — valuation techniques for which inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to\\r\\nmeasure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there \\r\\nis little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective \\r\\nremains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset\\r\\nor owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs shall reflect the assumptions that market participants would use when\\r\\npricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n57 \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 30 June 2020 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 3 293 669 0 0 3 293 669 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 99 139 55 0 99 194 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 9 198 746 9 198 746 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial assets 0 0 12 170 12 170 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 9 489 0 0 9 489 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 3 839 0 3 839 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Goverments 213 239 0 0 213 239 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 23 965 0 0 23 965 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial corporations 0 0 14 707 14 707 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 46 349 768 47 117 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 140 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  3 639 501  50 243  9 226 531  12 916 275  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are disclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 72 825 30 299 0 103 124 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 8 436 938 1 907 634 10 344 572 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 497 279 658 373 0 1 155 652 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 61 597 61 597 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 42 193 1 514 43 707 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  570 104  9 167 803  1 970 744  11 708 652  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n58 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 31 December 2019 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 2 924 019 0 0 2 924 019 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 141 596 49 0 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 10 324 772 10 324 772 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial assets 0  0 29 113 29 113 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 3 021 0 0 3 021 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 4 033 0 4 033 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Goverments 195 989 0 0 195 989 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 15 023 0 0 15 023 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial corporations 0 0 12 851 12 851 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 58 087 1 130 59 217 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 140 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  3 279 648  62 169  10 368 006  13 709 823  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are disclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 29 080 951 612 0 980 692 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 8 074 410 2 161 033 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 653 967 0 653 967 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 45 303 45 303 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 56 042 2 262 58 304 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  29 080  9 736 031  2 208 598  11 973 709  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss (Pension Funds) - The value date method is used in the \\r\\nacquisition of pension fund units managed by Luminor Pensions Estonia AS and they are initially recognised at acquisition cost, which \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n59 \\r\\n\\r\\nis the fair value paid for them. Pension fund units are revalued according to the effective net asset value on the balance sheet date.The \\r\\nfollowing methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:  \\r\\n\\r\\n• Cash and cash balances with central banks – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at the same \\r\\nprice in an orderly transaction;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Due from other credit institutions – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at the same price\\r\\nin an orderly transaction. Due from other credit institutions are demand deposits;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Loans to customers – fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows with the loan portfolio\\r\\naverage rate which was calculated based on the Bank  new sales margin of Q1 2020 and total volume of the loan portfolio\\r\\nthat included  credit risk factors. Same valuation technique is applied to all loan classes and accordingly all loan classes are\\r\\nclassified under fair value level 3. As at 31 December 2019 fair value was estimated by discounting estimated future cash\\r\\nflows with the base curve used by the Bank (6m Euribor curve as average for all loans) as adjusted by credit riks factors; \\r\\n\\r\\n• Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (debt securities) - for domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states,\\r\\nthe quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading\\r\\noffers in the form of prices, yields or equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid\\r\\nprices shall be used taking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no\\r\\nquotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are clearly incorrect or\\r\\nartificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or similar;\\r\\n\\r\\n• The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the interest rates for\\r\\nitems with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured using the assumptions that market\\r\\nparticipants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (equities, debt securities):\\r\\n\\r\\n• The quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source for local equities. These are securities for\\r\\nwhich active market exists based on the turnover, meaning availability of quotes at which market participants\\r\\ntransact in the local stock market. The quotes of foreign equities shall be taken from Bloomberg giving the priority\\r\\nto the primary market, and then to the country of issuer if the active market exists there. Otherwise, the market\\r\\nwith the highest liquidity (turnover) shall be used as a source for pricing. If the quotes in primary data sources are\\r\\nclearly incorrect or artificial, the price of particular equity shall be derived from liquid market data using sources\\r\\nlike Bloomberg or similar. Correctness of the quotes described above are the subject of expert judgment of the\\r\\nMarket and Liquidity Risk Management Department member together with the Bank’s Markets Department’s\\r\\ndealer responsible for equity trading. For equities of non-listed companies for which active market does not exist,\\r\\nany available trusted public information on recent trades shall be used for the pricing of the equity. Alternatively,\\r\\ndividend discount model shall be used to determine the price of equity. Expert opinion based on other available\\r\\nrelated market data shall be used for pricing of equity if the previously described methods are not possible;\\r\\n\\r\\n• For domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the\\r\\npriority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading offers in the form of prices, yields or\\r\\nequivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid prices shall be used taking\\r\\nthe data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no quotes available \\r\\nfrom local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are clearly incorrect or artificial, \\r\\nthe prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or\\r\\nsimilar;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Derivative financial instruments – market data from financial data vendors, electronic trading platforms or third-party valuation\\r\\nare used for valuation purposes. The derivatives represent non-complex products valued with generally accepted models.\\r\\nValuation inputs are derived from the market data;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Loans and deposits from credit institutions – the fair value of loans equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the loans from credit \\r\\ninstitutions is under market conditions. Expected cash flows of the liabilities from the banks are discounted with the same \\r\\nmarket rates as loans. Loans from credit institutions are long-term. Deposits from credit institutions are demand deposits. The\\r\\nfair value of deposits equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the deposits from credit institutions is under market conditions;\\r\\n\\r\\n• Deposits from customers – the gross carrying amount of demand deposits as a fair value is applied as an approximation due to\\r\\nvery short maturities;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n60 \\r\\n\\r\\n• Debt securities issued – the debt securities issued by the Bank are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs and are \\r\\nsubsequently carried at amortized cost using effective interest rate (EIR) method. The fair value is calculated by discounting the \\r\\nfuture cash flows using the market interest rate yield curve. Covered bonds are classified as Level 1 as they are actively traded\\r\\non market using the market rate yield curve (swaps curve) provided by Bloomberg.\\r\\n\\r\\n18.

SEGMENT REPORTING\\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as the Management Board. The Management \\r\\nBoard monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and \\r\\nperformance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit before tax and is measured consistently with profit before \\r\\ntax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of expenses after internal funds transfer pricing, as \\r\\nmanagement primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a performance measure. Fees and commission \\r\\nincome for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made between different product categories for segment \\r\\nreporting.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth Management. \\r\\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. Corporate Banking segment \\r\\nservices business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager and all leasing customers who do not have a bank relationship. \\r\\nRetail Banking segment services business customers without a dedicated relationship manager and private individuals not belonging to \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n62 \\r\\n\\r\\nWealth Management segment. Wealth Management services wealthy private individuals and holding companies associated with those \\r\\nindividuals. Results of other operating segments are included in Other segment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments (including \\r\\ninternal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Other segment) and income and expenses not booked on \\r\\ncustomer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using internally agreed allocation mechanisms. Only assets and \\r\\nliabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating segments are reported under the respective segments, all other balance \\r\\nsheet items are not reported under the operating segments to CODM. Loans and Deposits are reported under operating segments at \\r\\nGross amounts (and excluding accrued interest). Net impairment (losses/reversal) on loans to customers is monitored for each of the \\r\\nsegments at Profit or Loss side, while at the Assets side, the CODM only monitors Gross amounts of Loans to customers, with \\r\\nimpairment allowances not being allocated to operating segments. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first quarter of 2020 it was decided to transfer customers with leasing exposures but without a relationship to bank entities \\r\\nfrom Other segment to Corporate segment and restatement was made also to historic periods. From the first quarter of 2020 Luminor \\r\\nstarted applying Activity Based Costing to allocate personnel costs, administrative costs and depreciation between operating segments \\r\\nand restatement was also made to segment split of costs to 2019 figures. The asymmetrical allocation of allowance for impairment Net \\r\\nimpairment (losses/reversal) on loans to customers, as described above, was applied from the second quarter of 2020. Comparative \\r\\ninformation for Loans and Advances as of 31 December 2019 was changed accordingly. \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Corporate Retail \\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement \\r\\nOther Total

Our responsibility is to express a \\r\\nconclusion on these condensed consolidated interim financial statements based on our review. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nScope of review  \\r\\n \\r\\nWe conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) \\r\\n(Estonia) 2410, \\'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the \\r\\nEntity\\'. A review of condensed consolidated interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, \\r\\nprimarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other \\r\\nreview procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with \\r\\nInternational Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we \\r\\nwould become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do \\r\\nnot express an audit opinion. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion  \\r\\n \\r\\nBased on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the \\r\\naccompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material \\r\\nrespects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, \\'Interim Financial Reporting\\' as \\r\\nadopted by the European Union. \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAS PricewaterhouseCoopers \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\nAgo Vilu \\r\\nAuditor’s certificate no.325 \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n17 August 2020 \\r\\nTallinn, Estonia \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tCEO Comment\\r\\n\\tManagement report\\r\\n\\tGeneral information\\r\\n\\tMacroeconomic overview\\r\\n\\tCOVID-19 impact on Luminor\\r\\n\\tBusiness development\\r\\n\\tProduct and digital development\\r\\n\\tthe retail banking segment\\r\\n\\tthe corporate banking segment\\r\\n\\tthe WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT\\r\\n\\tCorporate social responsibility\\r\\n\\tEFFORTS TO PREVENT Financial crime\\r\\n\\tother events\\r\\n\\tevents after 30 june\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFinancial results\\r\\n\\tlending and deposits\\r\\n\\tASSET QUALITY FOR Q2 2020\\r\\n\\tFUNDING\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOn 13 September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, with a stable outlook.

Looking out for the health and safety of our employees and customers continued to be our major concern, while at \\r\\nthe same time using our strong financial standing for the benefit of Luminor customers. We have strengthened our \\r\\norganisational capabilities and are constantly working with different scenarios for how the crisis may evolve and the economic \\r\\nimpact it may have.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic economies were strong when they entered the pandemic and they have demonstrated greater stability and flexibility \\r\\nthroughout it than the euro area average, experiencing the mildest economic downturn in the EU. Cooperation between \\r\\ndifferent stakeholders in the public and private sectors has been successful in providing support to customers, proving that \\r\\ngood results can be achieved through collaboration.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued into the second half of the year with a strong funding base and improved profitability. By the end of \\r\\nSeptember, we had reduced further the share of non-performing loans, lowering them to 3.7% of the loan portfolio. Over the \\r\\npast year the loans-to-deposits ratio strengthened from 108% to 87%. The improved funding structure and reduced lending \\r\\nvolumes that have been achieved over time have made it possible for Luminor to become fully self-funded with no outstanding \\r\\nfunding from its former parent banks as of the end of September 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe headway that was made towards becoming a fully standalone bank was also supported by continuous progress in the carve-\\r\\nout of services from the DNB and Nordea systems across all three countries. We are already operating technology platforms in \\r\\nLatvia and Lithuania that are fully independent of the systems of either DNB or Nordea. In the third quarter, we launched the \\r\\nnew banking platform for internal pilot users in Estonia and made preparations for the market launch and migration of all of \\r\\nour Estonian customers, which is planned for the fourth quarter of this year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter, Luminor’s Retail Banking focused on business growth and on improving the customer experience. The \\r\\npositive trends in the market and in the overall outlook were evidenced by the interest customers showed in taking mortgages, \\r\\nwhich was greater than before the pandemic, and by sales of consumer loans, which reached their pre-pandemic level in the \\r\\nthird quarter. The volume of deposits in the Retail Banking segment increased by 41 million EUR, a significant step up from the \\r\\nfall of 24 million EUR in the same period last year. Luminor’s Corporate Banking expanded their lending book by 78 million EUR \\r\\nin the third quarter and disbursed several new large investment loans.  The third quarter also saw significant growth in \\r\\ninvestment volumes for the Private Banking segment with investment assets up 13% on the same quarter of 2019 and 8% on \\r\\nthe previous quarter. Pension assets increased by 6% in comparison with the year before and 1.8% with the previous quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is continuously vigilant about financial crime and is committed to preventing, detecting and reporting it. In the third \\r\\nquarter we established the Customer Risk Management Department, streamlining anti-financial crime and sanctions risks \\r\\nmanagement. We also introduced an improved solution for online monitoring of transactions in the third quarter of 2020.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s story is a story of change. In the three years since Luminor was created, we have undergone a unique transformation. \\r\\nThere is one more considerable effort ahead of us, which is the migration of our Estonian customers to the new technological \\r\\nplatform and new banking channels. Then we will be in the long-awaited position where we can start the next stage of our \\r\\ntransformation process, the stage of growth.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCreating Luminor has been a singular and intense experience. Sometimes we need to pass on the baton so that we can keep up \\r\\nthe pace and energy that are needed for this journey. In order to ensure that Luminor has the best possible leader with the \\r\\nskills, experience and energy that best suit our new stage of transformation, I suggested to the Supervisory Council that they \\r\\nshould start looking for such a leader to steer the next stages of Luminor’s development.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI am convinced that Peter Bosek, the new CEO of Luminor who will start in this position in the new year, is the best person to \\r\\nsteer the next stage of our transformation and that the bank will reach many new milestones under his leadership, which will \\r\\nfirst of all benefit our customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor will continue as a strong Baltic bank. We are a bank that was created for local customers and the local community and \\r\\nwe will invest all our energy in continually improving our customer experience and in developing our products and services.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 4  \\r\\n\\r\\nI want to thank our team, our customers, and our investors for choosing Luminor as a partner on this journey.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been an honour. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\n\\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 5  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral information \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor) was established on 1 October 2017 through the merger of the Baltic operations of DNB Bank ASA \\r\\n(Commercial Register no. 984 851 006, DNB) and Nordea Bank Abp (Commercial Register no. 2858394-9, Nordea) to create a \\r\\nnew-generation financial service provider for local businesses and financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 it was announced that the transaction signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB, Nordea and US-\\r\\nbased private equity firm Blackstone had been concluded and as a result a consortium led by private equity funds managed by \\r\\nBlackstone acquired a 60.1% majority stake in the bank. The bank’s initial owners Nordea and DNB each retained a 19.95% \\r\\nequity stake in Luminor, but an arrangement has been made by the consortium and Nordea for the purchase of Nordea’s \\r\\nremaining stake over the coming years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with some 900 000 clients, 2 355 employees, and market \\r\\nshare of 16.3% in deposits and 17.4% in lending as at the end of September 2020. Luminor has total shareholders’ equity of 1.6 \\r\\nbillion EUR and it is capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 22.0%. Luminor’s core business is serving entrepreneurial people in the \\r\\nBaltics with a primary focus on local companies and the financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers its customers a wide range of products and services through all possible channels, digital and physical, with 34 \\r\\ncustomer service centres in total in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, of which seven are meet-up points. Luminor owns 363 ATMs \\r\\nthroughout the Baltic states, and additionally provides services through 100 ATMs in partnership with other financial services \\r\\nproviders.  \\r\\n\\r\\n30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Estonia Latvia Lithuania GroupGr Total  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of customers ~128 000 ~219 000 ~550 000 ~897 000 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket shares      \\r\\n\\r\\nLending 12.2% 22.0% 19.5% 17.4% \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits 9.3% 15.8% 22.0% 16.3% \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of client service \\r\\ncentres, including meet- \\r\\nup points \\r\\n\\r\\n8 10 16 34  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of employees 566 831 958 2 355 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe spread of coronavirus in the Baltic states has been more limited than in euro area peers, on average. As a consequence, the \\r\\neconomies of the three states were less impacted by COVID-19 than other parts of Europe. In the second quarter, real GDP \\r\\ncontracted by 6.5% over the year in Estonia, 8.6% in Latvia and 4.0% in Lithuania, as compared to an average fall of 14.7% in \\r\\nthe euro area. Despite the uncertainty created by coronavirus, the volume of retail trade exceeded its level of the previous year \\r\\nas early as May in Estonia and Lithuania, with Latvia exceeding its pre-crisis level in June. Industrial production for August was \\r\\ndown 5% over the year in Estonia and 3% in Latvia, while in Lithuania it was up 2.1% on its level of last year. In comparison, \\r\\nproduction volumes in the euro area were down 7%. \\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer confidence was supported by stronger balance sheets ahead of the pandemic, with accumulated savings and modest \\r\\nleverage, to social transfers, and wage growth. There were no external imbalances to correct during the current pandemic as \\r\\nthe Baltic states have run substantial external surpluses and close to balance budget positions in the past decade.  However the \\r\\npurchase of durables continues to lag the more general economy recovery. New car sales are down on average by 30% at \\r\\npresent. \\r\\n\\r\\nLooking forward, the prospects of recovery for the open economies of the Baltic states will depend on how the global economy \\r\\nand key export markets in Europe recover. The recovery will benefit from substantial fiscal support, non-financial sector and \\r\\nstate liquidity buffers, and the EU pandemic and structural funds. Furthermore, a well-capitalised financial sector that is allowed \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 6  \\r\\n\\r\\nto refinance loans and extend new credit to the non-financial sector will be crucial for the outlook for future growth. Even with \\r\\na substantial discretionary fiscal boost, debt levels in the Baltic states will remain the lowest among euro area members. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe impact of COVID-19 on Luminor \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter we continued to apply all the measures needed to look after the safety and well-being of our staff and \\r\\ncustomers in the face of COVID-19. These include encouraging remote work, paying extra attention to cleaning and the \\r\\navailability of disinfectants in our offices and branches, and providing protective equipment to our customer-facing employees.    \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also continued our efforts to promote remote services and we introduced a system of pre-booked visits in our customer \\r\\nservice centres so we could minimise physical contacts and safe-guard against COVID-19. We have expanded our remote \\r\\nservices to support pre-booking in our client service centres so that customers can have the majority of their questions \\r\\nanswered already remotely. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll Luminor employees are regularly informed about all current guidelines, restrictions and recommendations so that they can \\r\\nkeep themselves and their customers safe and help prevent the spread of the virus. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are monitoring the situation closely and are ready to adjust our work and processes swiftly if the pandemic should require \\r\\nus to do that.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the pandemic Luminor has supported its customers when needed, including by providing temporary grace periods \\r\\nfor principal loan payments when this has been required by the customers. As at the end of third quarter of 2020, grace periods \\r\\nhad been granted to customers representing 14.5% of the corporate loan portfolio across the Baltics, which was 0.2% less than \\r\\nin the adjusted second quarter, and 8.4% of the mortgage portfolio, or 0.3% more than in the second quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness development \\r\\n\\r\\nThe transformation of Luminor continued in the third quarter. Some further adjustments were made in the operational \\r\\nstructure to support a more efficient organisation and prepare for the next stage of our development. \\r\\n\\r\\nProgress has been made in the carve-out of services from the DNB and Nordea systems across all three countries. In Latvia and \\r\\nLithuania Luminor finalised the migration of customers to a common banking platforms, which are fully independent of the \\r\\nsystems of either DNB or Nordea. Work to complete the migration and decommission of historical data is underway.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new banking platform in Estonia was launched in the third quarter for internal pilot-users and preparations were made to \\r\\nlaunch the update in October, as well as to carry out the market launch and customer migration also planned for the fourth \\r\\nquarter of 2020.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter we continued extending and strengthening our remote customer onboarding capabilities. Having already \\r\\ndone so in Latvia and Lithuania, we launched private customer remote onboarding in Estonia, and introduced technical and \\r\\nprocess improvements across all three countries to improve customer experience and ensure quality of the service. The share \\r\\nof private customers onboarded remotely grew to 18% by the end of September 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor Investor platform, which was launched at the end of last year in Latvia and Lithuania and at the beginning of the \\r\\nyear in Estonia, has attracted 28 million EUR of new assets as at the end of the third quarter,  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have concluded 315 agreements with customers for the e-Commerce Gateway, which was launched for Mass Business \\r\\ncustomers at the end of the first quarter of 2020. The e-Commerce Gateway provides card acquiring services that let businesses \\r\\naccept VISA and Mastercard cards, and it uses the Open Banking application programming interfaces (APIs) of major banks so \\r\\nthat account-to-account payments can be acquired. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus of Retail Banking in the third quarter centred on the three pillars of mortgage loans, consumer loans and new \\r\\ncustomer acquisition.  \\r\\n \\r\\nVolumes of new sales of mortgages were up by 6% on the previous quarter. Interest from customers in taking mortgages was \\r\\ngreater than before the pandemic, aided by the reduction in restrictions on new lending introduced in response to COVID-19. A \\r\\nnew credit risk strategy was developed to adjust to the market situation, while continuous improvements were made to the \\r\\nnew and existing customer experience in lending consultations, the application process and interactions around contracts. \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 7  \\r\\n\\r\\nSales of consumer loans increased to their pre-COVID level in the third quarter, with volumes of new sales up by 3 million EUR \\r\\non the previous quarter. The new credit risk strategy was introduced, and COVID-19 lending restrictions were reduced. \\r\\nDeposits increased by 41 million EUR, as compared to a decrease of 24 million EUR in the same period last year. \\r\\n \\r\\nAs the pandemic stabilised during the summer, a consumer loan campaign was launched in the third quarter that was targeted \\r\\nat home improvement. A campaign to gain new private customers was launched, promoting the new Luminor Black payment \\r\\ncard and awareness of the remote onboarding process in the Latvian and Lithuanian markets.  \\r\\n \\r\\nThe customer service centres of Liepkalnis and Žirmūnai in Vilnius, Lithuania, were relocated to Paupys and reopened with a \\r\\nnew concept. For customer convenience, the new centre is designed not only for financial consultations, but also for events and \\r\\nseminars.  \\r\\n \\r\\nRetail Banking continued with the transformation process in the third quarter to support the next stage of growth and focus on \\r\\ndigital daily services by redesigning the customer service process and advisory concept, and optimising channels and the \\r\\norganisational structure. \\r\\n \\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Corporate Banking segment increased market activities in the third quarter, expanding lending by 78 million EUR.  A \\r\\nhealthy increase was observed in the use of overdrafts, especially in seasonal activity among grain wholesalers. Several new, \\r\\nlarge investment loans were drawn, notably in the commercial real estate segment.   \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit volumes increased by 718 million EUR on the back of large increases in public sector deposits. The introduction of \\r\\nnegative deposit rates was communicated to the largest depositors in September, and these started to apply from 1 October \\r\\n2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nPension assets stood at 1.4 billion EUR, which was 6% more than a year earlier and 1.8% more than in the previous quarter. By \\r\\nthe end of the third quarter, Luminor had some 289 000 second pillar pension customers and 62 000 third pillar customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe third quarter of 2020 saw significant growth of investment volumes for the Private Banking segment. Investment assets \\r\\nwere up 13% on the same quarter of 2019 and 8% on the previous quarter.    \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor Investor platform and Portfolio Management continue to offer preferred investment services in combination with \\r\\nthe high-quality Private Banking service.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe safety and well-being of Luminor employees and customers continued to be the top priority in the third quarter of 2020 in \\r\\nall the bank’s activities. Promoting and supporting remote services and e-business was very much in focus in the corporate \\r\\nsocial responsibility area as well.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued in the third quarter with the community investment project by developing a dedicated knowledge and \\r\\ntraining hub that can support local companies and organisations in taking their activities online and advancing their current e-\\r\\nbusiness capabilities.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWorking with the Ethnographic Open-Air Museum of Latvia, Luminor introduced the e-fair platform egadatirgus.lv so that the \\r\\n50th season of the Latvian applied arts folk fair could happen and supported local merchants with an e-commerce gateway \\r\\nsolution. The event had 178 merchants registered and 15 000 unique visitors. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo contribute to a wider discussion on developing the Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) framework, Luminor \\r\\nparticipated in a comprehensive ESG integration study carried out at the initiative of the European Commission among banks \\r\\nfrom all the EU countries. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo promote equality and diversity further in the workplace, Luminor adopted an updated Equality, Non-discrimination, and \\r\\nDiversity Policy in the third quarter.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSpecial focus was put on promoting information security and data protection among the bank’s customers and on warning them \\r\\nagainst possible fraudsters. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo promote governance enhancement, governance ownership was transferred to come under the direct supervision of the CEO \\r\\nin the third quarter, to ensure that due focus is turned on this important topic.  Adjustments were also made in Corporate \\r\\nGovernance to align it with the new risk policies and to support the new suitability assessment process. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 8  \\r\\n\\r\\nEFFORTS TO PREVENT FINANCIAL CRIME  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are committed to preventing, detecting and reporting financial crime.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe regularly review our anti-financial crime (AFC) practices and invest in the human and technological resources that are \\r\\nneeded. We work constantly to get a better understanding of our customers and their transactions, and to manage and report \\r\\nany potential financial crime risk. Luminor predominantly serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers who \\r\\nhave a strong personal or business connection to the Baltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, Luminor continued to apply its financial crime risk management framework in order to \\r\\nprevent, detect, manage and report potential financial crime, and this was supported by its conservative approach towards \\r\\nmoney laundering and financial crime. The framework covers the technology, policies and procedures employed to prevent and \\r\\ndetect financial crime, assess risks, run training and awareness-raising, and monitor new and developing financial crime risks \\r\\ncontinuously.  \\r\\n\\r\\nStarting from the third quarter Luminor has transformed the Customer Data Quality Middle Office into the Customer Risk \\r\\nManagement Department by segregating duties between the first and second lines of defence to streamline anti-financial crime \\r\\noperational controls and the sound risk management practices aligned with the appropriate governance set-up.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is a subject to a wide range of legal requirements, and so we are transparent in all our activities and we work closely \\r\\nwith all the supervisory and regulatory authorities. Luminor also follows the international guidelines, recommendations and \\r\\nstandards issued by the regulatory and supervisory authorities, international bodies, local banking associations, and financial \\r\\nintelligence units in each Baltic state.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to invest in systems and processes so we can adapt in a constantly changing environment - an example is \\r\\nthe improved solution for online transaction monitoring that was introduced in the third quarter of 2020. The bank is \\r\\ndeveloping further its common monitoring and screening solution in all three Baltic states and has approved several additional \\r\\ndevelopments that will be delivered during 2020 and 2021.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor considers that work to raise awareness is an important component of the financial crime risk management framework. \\r\\nIn the third quarter, 16 training events related to AFC and corporate compliance areas were held on 11 different topics.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER EVENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nJohan Pedersson Lilliehöök resigned from the Supervisory Council of Luminor Bank AS, effective 1 August 2020. Mathias Favetto \\r\\nhas been appointed to the Supervisory Council as the shareholder representative of Blackstone, effective 26 August 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nIndrek Heinloo has resigned as the Head of the Programme Office and Member of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS, \\r\\neffective 1 September 2020. Following the near completion of Luminor’s New Bank Programme, the Programme Office has been \\r\\nmerged with the Technology Division under its current management. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 September 2020 it was announced that Erkki Raasuke, Chief Executive Officer, will leave the group effective 1 January \\r\\n2021, ahead of the next stage of Luminor’s evolution. Luminor has appointed Peter Bosek as Chief Executive Officer, effective 1 \\r\\nJanuary 2021. Erkki Raasuke will continue to lead the company in the interim period. \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 30 SEPTEMBER \\r\\n\\r\\nJonas Eriksson resigned as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Member of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS effective \\r\\n10 October 2020. The bank announced Eriksson’s decision to resign on 17 August 2020. The Supervisory Council of the bank \\r\\nhas commenced a comprehensive search process for a new CFO. Until a new CFO is appointed, Erkki Raasuke, Chairman of the \\r\\nManagement Board, will oversee responsibility for the bank’s finance function at the Management Board level, supported by \\r\\nOlof Sundblad, Head of Treasury, who will be acting CFO during the interim period. \\r\\n\\r\\nEffective 1 October 2020 the Wealth Management Division was merged with the Retail Banking Division under its current \\r\\nmanagement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the end of the third quarter and the reporting date, Luminor exited one credit. This decreased its non-performing loan \\r\\nportfolio by 40 million EUR. As a result, the previously recognized loan losses decreased by 9 million EUR. \\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 9  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit in the third quarter was 22.2 million EUR, 5.3 million EUR more than in the same quarter of last year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income was 58.2 million EUR having been 64.6 million EUR in the same quarter last year. This decline is explained \\r\\nby the our strategy to reprice and rightsize the balance sheet, which has seen the loans-to-deposits ratio move from 108% to \\r\\n87% over the past year. Net commission income was 1% more than in the same quarter of last year, showing the recovery of \\r\\neconomic activity after COVID-19. Net other operating income was lower than in the same quarter of last year, mainly because of \\r\\nthe non-recurrence of income from the sale of an office building in the third quarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses were 63.5 million EUR, which is 8.0 million EUR less than a year earlier. Exceptional costs in the third \\r\\nquarter reached 20.6 million EUR, 22% (5.8 million EUR) less than the comparable exceptional costs for the same period last \\r\\nyear*, as the significant systems consolidation and customer migration project neared completion. The largest part of the \\r\\nexceptional costs in the third quarter of this year were IT expenses, which constituted 77% of the total, while staff costs were \\r\\nanother 19%. Total operating expenses excluding exceptional costs were  5% lower in the third quarter than in the same period \\r\\nlast year. The cost-to-income ratio excluding exceptional costs for the third quarter was 50.3% in 2020 as compared to 46.4% in \\r\\nthe third quarter of 2019, and for the nine months in 2020, 50,8%, lower than the 52.1% for the nine months of 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor achieved net reversal of impairment in this quarter and the annualised net credit impairment ratio for the first nine \\r\\nmonths of the year is 0.39%. Luminor has also continued to reduce its portfolio of non-performing loans, which reached  3.7% of \\r\\nthe loan portfolio by end of the quarter. Return on equity excluding exceptional costs for the third quarter ratio was 9.7% in 2020 \\r\\nand 9.6% in 2019, the nine months ratio was 6.3% in 2020, compared to 12.5% in 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n*The comparable exceptional cost for the first six months of 2020 was 54.1 million EUR, and it was 39.8 million EUR during the same \\r\\nperiod in 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nKey figures and ratios of Luminor**   \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\nQ3 Q2 Q3  January - September Full Year      \\r\\n\\r\\n2020  2020 2019 2020 2019 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit 22 230 13 463 16 887 14 501 49 965 53 997 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity 1 635 200 1 616 621 1 624 589 1 639 739 1 715 956 1 714 685 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE), % 5.4 3.3 4.1 1.2 3.9 3.1 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets 13 832 140 13 357 895 13 905 118 13 966 964 14 548 418 14 522 261 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA), % 0.6 0.4 0.5 0.1 0.5 0.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 58 162 55 878 64 589 169 847 196 744 244 167 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets 13 559 297 13 080 712 13 579 747 13 672 835 14 230 763 14 192 831 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM), % 1.7 1.7 1.9 1.7 1.8 1.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio (C/I), % 74.6 80.5 73.5 81.2 75.9 77.6 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio, %*** -0.03 0.13 0.33 0.39 0.15 0.22 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 9 626 948 9 616 727 10 760 156 9 626 948 10 760 156 10 222 547 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 11 070 312 10 344 572 9 923 439 11 070 312 9 923 439 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio, % 87.0 93.0 108.4 87.0 108.4 99.9 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET1 ratio, % 22.0 22.0 18.7 22.0 18.7 19.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio (gross), % 3.7 4.0 4.3 3.7 4.3 3.8 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income / Loans, % 2.4 2.3 2.4 2.3 2.4 2.4 \\r\\n\\r\\n** Quarterly ratios (ROE, ROA, NIM, C/I, Credit impairment ratio) are expressed on an annualised basis \\r\\n\\r\\n*** If loan recoveries prevail, the ratio is negative \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 10  \\r\\n\\r\\nExplanations  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity (belonging to the owners of the company) = (equity at the end of the reporting period + equity at the end of the previous period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) = Net profit / Average equity * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets = (assets at the end of the reporting period + assets at the end of the previous period) / 2  \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) = Net profit / Average assets * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets = (interest-earning assets at the end of the reporting period + interest-earning assets at the end of the previous period) \\r\\n/ 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) = Net interest income / Average interest earning assets * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio = Total operating expenses / Net total operating income * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio = Net losses or reversal on loans to customers / Net loans, average * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio = Loans to customers / Deposits from customers * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio = Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-weighted Assets \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL (non-performing loan) ratio = Gross impaired loans (Stage 3 loans) / Gross loans * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income / Loans = Net interest income / Net loans, average * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLENDING AND DEPOSITS  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lending portfolio totalled 9 627 million EUR at the end of the third quarter being down from 10 760 million EUR a year \\r\\nearlier.

Luminor’s \\r\\nexposure towards these sectors is small at 0.6% of the total net lending to customers. Almost half of the net exposure within \\r\\nthese affected sectors is classified as Stage 1 exposure, about 20% is Stage 2 and some 30% is Stage 3.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have supported our customers through the pandemic notably via loan modifications. The most common modification \\r\\nrequested was a grace period on principal payments. Grace period on principal and interest payments was granted only in \\r\\nexceptional circumstances, and to around 1% of all modifications. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe stock of the requests for modifications including grace periods stood at 1.1 billion EUR at the end of the third quarter and \\r\\ncovered 11% of the total credit portfolio, which is almost the same as at the end of the second quarter. The flow of modification \\r\\nrequests has almost stopped, with only a small flow remaining for mortgage loans, where modification requests increased by \\r\\n16 million EUR in the third quarter. The total value of modifications approved reached almost 1.0 billion EUR at the end of \\r\\nSeptember 2020. From the above mentioned received and approved modification requests grace periods have already expired \\r\\nfor around 36% of the modified exposures, and this has not led to any noticeable changes in overdue loans within these \\r\\nexposures. The level of exposures overdue by more than 5 days after the end of the grace period is only slightly higher, by just \\r\\n0.4 percentage point, than it is in the portfolio without modifications. The largest concentration for the end of grace periods is \\r\\nin October 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome 64% of the requests for modifications came from business customers. The largest part of the requests from business \\r\\ncustomers for modifications came from industries like real estate activities, transportation and storage, wholesale and retail \\r\\ntrade, and manufacturing. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s loan loss provision reversals, including provisions for off-balance sheet commitments, reached 0.3 million EUR \\r\\nduring the third quarter. An increase in individual provisions for the reclassification of one larger COVID-19 related exposure \\r\\nfrom Stage 2 to Stage 3 and another exposure in the subsidised energy industry were offset by a positive outcome from the \\r\\nresolution of other legacy non-performing exposures and a reduction in Stage 2 provisions. The loan loss provisions excluding \\r\\nthe off-balance sheet commitments were 29.6 million EUR for the first half of the year, bringing the total for the first nine months \\r\\nof 2020 to 29.0 million EUR. The loan loss provisions for off-balance sheet commitments reached 3.1 million EUR, bringing the \\r\\ntotal loan loss provisions to 32.1 million EUR for the first nine months of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe share of non-performing loans, or the NPL ratio, was 3.7% at the end of the quarter, which is 0.3 percentage point lower \\r\\nthan in the previous quarter. Even though the COVID-19 driven inflow continued in the third quarter, the outflow was more \\r\\nthan three times the inflow, and this left the volume of non-performing loans at its historically lowest level ever. The key drivers \\r\\nfor the decrease in the non-performing portfolio were collection activities including sales of collaterals, sales of claim rights, \\r\\nand write-offs of the amounts remaining after collection activities. The NPL ratio for the mortgage loan portfolio was 2.6%, \\r\\nwhich represents a decrease of 0.4 percentage point. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal allowances for expected credit losses on the balance sheet were 176.6 million EUR at the end of the quarter, of which \\r\\n126.9 million EUR were for Stage 3 exposures. Non-performing loans totalled 361.7 million EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n

This has been achieved over time \\r\\nby reducing lending volumes and by improving the funding structure.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers stood at 11 070 million EUR at the end of the third quarter, and at 10 344 million EUR at the end of \\r\\nthe second quarter. In addition the total nominal value of the bonds outstanding under the Euro Medium Term Note or EMTN \\r\\nprogramme was 1 150 million EUR, consisting of 650 million EUR of senior unsecured bonds and a five-year 500 million EUR \\r\\ncovered bond. There were no new issuances during the third quarter. In September 2020 Luminor doubled the Cover Pool of \\r\\nits covered bonds by adding a portfolio of Latvian mortgage loans.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a committed funding facility agreement with its former parent banks, DNB and Nordea, that is provided in the \\r\\nform of a syndicate, with each partner in the syndicate providing 50% of the funding. At the end of the third quarter the total \\r\\nfacility stood at 1 037 million EUR and was undrawn. The total commitment was reduced by 1 300 million EUR during the third \\r\\nquarter following a voluntary cancellation by Luminor. The amount of the facility has been committed for five years from 1 \\r\\nOctober 2019, with an initial commitment for three years and the option for Luminor to extend it by up to two years, and it can \\r\\nbe drawn with maturities of one, two or three years. The facility is partly secured, as Luminor had assigned mortgage loans to \\r\\nit with a carrying value of 1 034 million EUR at the end of the third quarter of 2020 and of 1 667 million EUR at the end of the \\r\\nsecond quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nStructure of Liabilities and Equity: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 April 2020 Luminor received its minimum own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) requirement in a decision of the Single \\r\\nResolution Board (the SRB) dated 20 December 2019 that was executed for Luminor by a decision of the Estonian Financial \\r\\nSupervision and Resolution Authority, dated 1 April 2020. The MREL decision sets the following MREL requirements for \\r\\nLuminor: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Holding AS (the parent company of Luminor Bank AS) shall comply with the MREL at the consolidated level of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS of 17.28% of total liabilities and own funds at all times, and 11.97% of total liabilities and own funds \\r\\nshall be met with subordinated instruments; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Holding AS shall have a transitional period until 30 June 2022 to comply with these requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at the end of the third quarter of 2020 the total MREL ratio stood at 15.9% at the consolidated level of Luminor Bank AS, down \\r\\nfrom 16.6% at the end of the second quarter, while 11.3% of total liabilities and own funds were subordinated instruments as at \\r\\nthe end of the third quarter of 2020 and 11.8% of total liabilities and own funds were subordinated instruments as at the end of \\r\\nthe second quarter of 2020. It should be noted that the MREL requirements (set versus Total Liabilities and Own Funds) were \\r\\nset using data as of 31 March 2019, which means the decision (and thus the requirement) does not consider any subsequent \\r\\nevents impacting the capital requirements and thus also the MREL requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 17  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of \\r\\nBaa1/Prime-2, with a stable outlook. There have been no changes to Luminor’s ratings since then. On 25 September 2020 \\r\\nMoody’s issued an updated credit opinion for Luminor.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 March 2020 Moody’s assigned a definitive Aa1 rating to the mortgage covered bonds issued by Luminor Bank AS under \\r\\nthe Estonian Covered Bonds Act. \\r\\n\\r\\n  LIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s structural liquidity risk is conservative and well-balanced, and it is based on metrics that measure liquidity risk and \\r\\nis appropriately adapted to the current economic and regulatory environment. Luminor uses a range of metrics to measure \\r\\nliquidity risk, one of which is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The LCR for Luminor was 177% at the end of the third quarter \\r\\nof 2020 and 159% at the end of the second quarter under the definition of the LCR given in the Capital Requirements Regulation \\r\\n(CRR). The ratio increased as liquidity increased because lending volumes were lower. The liquidity buffer is composed of highly \\r\\nliquid central-bank-eligible securities and cash. Long-term liquidity risk is measured as the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). \\r\\nLuminor’s NSFR rose to 144% during the third quarter of 2020 from 133% at the end of the second quarter. The improvement \\r\\nwas driven by the increased deposit base benefiting the Available Stable Funding (AFS) and by the decrease in the amount of \\r\\nRequired Stable Funding (RSF). The RSF was impacted mainly by a reduction of the funding facility commitment lowering the \\r\\namount of encumbered assets. \\r\\n\\r\\n Q3 2020 Q2  2020 Q1  2020 Q4 2019 Q3  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 177.2% 159.0% 143.7% 149.8% 144.3% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR 143.6% 133.2% 126.0% 123.0% 118.0% \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are predominantly from residents of the Baltics.

Risk Exposure Amount (REA) was at 7 221 \\r\\nmillion EUR (31 December 2019: 7 969 million EUR). As at the end of the third quarter of 2020 Luminor had 1 588 million EUR \\r\\nin own funds and they were fully composed of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, meaning the Tier 1 and total capital ratios \\r\\nof Luminor stood at the same level as the CET1 ratio.  \\r\\n\\r\\n0.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.1%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.1% 1.1%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.4%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.5% 0.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.7%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.8%0.7%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.9%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.4%\\r\\n\\r\\nBaltic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania Other EU Non-EU \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 18  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with the CRR, was 10.7% as at the end of the third quarter of 2020.

The bonus share \\r\\nissue is based on the bank’s interim balance sheet as at January 2, 2019 and involves a partial conversion of share premium in the amount of \\r\\n216 030 920 EUR into share capital. Following the bonus issue, the share capital of the bank has been reduced by the same amount and was \\r\\npaid out to the shareholders in September 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 24  \\r\\n\\r\\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Notes \\r\\n1 January 2020 to \\r\\n\\r\\n30 September 2020 \\r\\n1 January 2019 to \\r\\n\\r\\n30 September 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flows from operating activities       \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit before tax   14 961 55 172 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustment for:     \\r\\n\\r\\n-Net impairment (-)/ reversal (+) on loans to customers, excluding off-balance sheet \\r\\ncommitments \\r\\n\\r\\n3 28 995 12 273 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Net impairment (-)/ reversal (+) on off-balance sheet commitments  3 095 -1 106 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Dividend income   -35 -58 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Share of profit from an associate   -1 025 0 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Loss (+) / profit (-) from foreign currency revaluation   606 10 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Depreciation, amortisation and impairment   8 930 10 051 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Other adjustments   50 1 605 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Interest income  4 -205 458 -227 866 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Interest expenses  4 35 611 31 122 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from operations before changes in operating assets/liabilities   -114 270 -118 797 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in operating assets/liabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of lending to customers   569 089 738 539 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of other assets   -24 227 -52 054 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (+) / decrease (-) of client deposits 12, 13  883 652 -1 757 951 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of liabilities   -37 778 46 339 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest received   200 696 228 949 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest paid   -33 819 -28 040 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncome tax paid   -10 818 -5 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from operating activites   1 546 795 -829 425 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nInvesting activities     \\r\\n\\r\\nAcquisition of property, equipment and intangible assets   -2 369 -5 757 \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from disposal of property, equipment and intangible assets  1 426 1 985 \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from disposals of investment property  1 208 14 902 \\r\\n\\r\\nDividend received   35 58 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from investing activities   300 11 188 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancing activities     \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 14  503 500 298 809 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayment of principal of parent funding \\r\\n                          \\r\\n\\r\\n12 \\r\\n-1 155 000 0 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 25  \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from parent funding 12 250 000 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments of principal on leases   -1 750 -2 953 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayout to the Shareholder  0 -216 031 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flows from financing activities   -403 250 79 825 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nNet increase (+) / decrease (-) in cash and cash equivalents   1 029 575 -857 209 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period  8,9 2 952 815 3 310 517 \\r\\n\\r\\nEffects of currency translation on cash and cash equivalents   -606 -10 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet increase (+) / decrease (-) in cash and cash equivalents   1 029 575 -857 209 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period   3 981 784 2 453 298 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents comprises     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash on hand  8 129 043 119 844 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-restricted  current account  with central bank  8 3 755 193 2 165 891 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions on demand or with original maturity of three \\r\\nmonths or less \\r\\n\\r\\n 9 97 548 167 563 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   3 981 784 2 453 298 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 26  \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL \\r\\nSTATEMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\n1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE INFORMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) is a local credit institution whose parent company is Luminor Holding AS \\r\\nthat is ultimately controlled by BCP VII, an investment fund managed by an affiliate of Blackstone Group Inc. Other shareholders \\r\\nof Luminor Holding AS - Nordea Bank Abp and DNB BANK ASA - are considered to be the entities with significant influence over \\r\\nthe Group. The Luminor Bank’s registered legal address is Liivalaia 45, 10145, Tallinn, Republic of Estonia. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Holding AS, established on 14 May 2019, is the parent company of Luminor Bank AS since 23 September 2019. Until 23 \\r\\nSeptember 2019 the parent company was Luminor Group AB. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor Bank AS has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries \\r\\nthrough the Estonian registered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone acquired a 60.1% majority stake in the \\r\\nLuminor Holding AS, the owner of Luminor Bank AS. Luminor Bank AS previous owners, Nordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB \\r\\nBANK ASA (\"DNB\"), each retained a 19.95% equity stake in the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current interim report, “Bank” (or Luminor Bank AS) refers to Luminor Bank AS. “Group” refers to the consolidated \\r\\nfinancial statements of Luminor Bank AS and its subsidiaries.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 September 2020 Luminor Bank AS directly or indirectly owned majority in the following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country Republic of \\r\\nEstonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country Republic of Latvia: Registered country Republic of \\r\\nLithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Liising AS  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Pensions Estonia AS \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Promano Estonia OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Asset Management IPAS \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Finance SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Līzings SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Realm SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 2 SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 3 SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 4 SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 6 SIA  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Trioleta SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Baltic ipasums SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Industrius UAB (under \\r\\nliquidation) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Intractus UAB \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Promano Lit UAB (under \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Recurso UAB (under \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Investiciju Valdymas \\r\\nUAB \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Lizingas UAB \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 September 2020 Luminor Bank AS had ownership in the following associated companies: \\r\\n\\uf0b7 ALD Automotive AS (25%)  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 ALD Automotive SIA (25%) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 ALD Automotive UAB (25%) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 SIA Kredītinformācijas Birojs (22,61%) \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) was prepared \\r\\nin accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU. The condensed consolidated interim financial \\r\\ninformation does not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read \\r\\nin conjunction with the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 27  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are consistent \\r\\nwith those followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, \\r\\nexcept for the adoption of new standards effective as of 1 January 2020. The Group has not early adopted any standard, \\r\\ninterpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. Several amendments and interpretations apply for the \\r\\nfirst time in 2020, but do not have a material impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS Interpretation Committee agenda decision regarding deferred tax related to investments in subsidiaries \\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Estonia and Latvia have replaced the traditional profit-based tax regimes with distribution-based tax regimes where \\r\\ncorporate income tax is not payable on profit but rather on distribution of dividends. In accordance with IAS 12.52A and 57A, in \\r\\ndistribution-based tax regimes no current or deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of undistributed profits until a liability \\r\\nto pay dividends is recognised. As a market practice in Estonia, this accounting policy has been applied consistently to all \\r\\nundistributed profits in the group, regardless of whether those profits accumulated in the parent or in the subsidiaries. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2020, IFRS Interpretation Committee made an agenda decision where it concluded that the principle set out in IAS 12.52A \\r\\nand 57A only applies to undistributed profits accumulated in the parent company and does not apply to undistributed profits \\r\\naccumulated in the subsidiaries. Instead, the principles described in IAS 12.39-40 should be followed in respect of undistributed \\r\\nprofits in subsidiaries, stipulating that a deferred tax shall be recognized in respect of such accumulated profits, unless it is \\r\\nprobable that they will not be distributed to the parent in the foreseeable future. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is currently assessing the potential impact of the IFRS Interpretation Committee agenda decision on its financial \\r\\nstatements and will reflect the impact, if any, in its 2020 annual financial statements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group presents financial information in interim report in the same format as it was presented in the annual financial \\r\\nstatements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019, except for several changes in classification within the \\r\\nConsolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as described below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in presentation \\r\\n\\r\\nContent of statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income has been reviewed for the Interm Report. Based on the \\r\\nreview results reclassifications were made for better understanding of the presented financial information. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 28  \\r\\n\\r\\nReclassification was made for following statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income items:  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\n1 January 2019  \\r\\nto 30 September 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nQ3 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nAs restated Change \\r\\nAs \\r\\n\\r\\npreviously \\r\\nreported \\r\\n\\r\\nAs \\r\\nrestated \\r\\n\\r\\nChange \\r\\nAs \\r\\n\\r\\npreviously \\r\\nreported \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest income calculated using the effective interest \\r\\nmethod \\r\\n\\r\\n184 415 +1 353 183 062 61 746 +269 61 477 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther similar income 43 451 -1 353 44 804 14 267 -269 14 536 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest and similar expense* -31 122 +7 546 -38 668 -11 424 +2 485 -13 909 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther operating expenses* -7 546 -7 546 0 -2 485 -2 485 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet gain on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair \\r\\nvalue through profit/loss \\r\\n\\r\\n480 -731 1 211 91 -204 295 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet gain on debt securities at fair value through profit or \\r\\nloss \\r\\n\\r\\n731 +731 0 204 +204 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet gain on financial assets and liabilities held for trading 3 868 -13 882 17 750 -2 341 -13 077 10 736 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet gain from financial derivatives 13 882 +13 882 0 13 077 +13 077 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther operating expenses** 0 +11 709 -11 709 0 +3 131 -3 131 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther administrative expenses** -114 197 -11 709 -102 488 -42 444 -3 131 -39 313 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther non-operating expenses -1 605 -1 106 -499 -143 -1 936 1 793 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (-) / reversal (+) on off-balance sheet \\r\\ncommitments \\r\\n\\r\\n1 106 +1 106 0 1 936 +1 936 0 \\r\\n\\r\\n*Cash contributions to resolution funds and quarantee schemas \\r\\n** Reclassification of other operating expenses to other administrative expenses due to review results which showed that by nature these \\r\\nexpenses were administrative expenses rather than operating expenses (legal expenses and VAT taxes, for example).  \\r\\n \\r\\nReclassification impacted the following condensed consolidated statement of cashflows items:  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n1 January 2019  \\r\\n\\r\\nto 30 September 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n As restated Change \\r\\nAs previously \\r\\n\\r\\nreported \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest and similar expense* 31 122 -7 546 38 668 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest paid -28 040 +7 546 -35 586 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (-) / reversal (+) on off-balance sheet commitments -1106 -1 106 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther adjustments 1605 +1 106 499 \\r\\n\\r\\n*Cash contributions to resolution funds and quarantee schemas \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and applies assumptions that affect the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements \\r\\nand the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on \\r\\nmanagement’s experience and expectations of future events. \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognizes credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The Standard applies a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) \\r\\napproach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not \\r\\nheld at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The assets \\r\\nto test for impairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes assets where \\r\\nthere has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or which are classified as low credit risk (credit rating \\r\\nindicating investment grade). The allowances for stage 1 assets are based on the expected credit losses associated with the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 29  \\r\\n\\r\\nprobability of default in the next twelve months (12-month expected credit loss). Stage 2 includes assets where there has been a \\r\\nsignificant increase in credit risk. The allowances for stage 2 assets are based on the expected credit losses associated with the \\r\\nprobability of default over the life of the asset (lifetime expected credit losses). Stage 3 includes credit-impaired (defaulted) \\r\\nassets, and the allowances reflect the lifetime expected credit losses. Material assets in stage 3 are tested for impairment on an \\r\\nindividual basis, while for immaterial stage 3 assets a collective assessment is performed. Loss allowances based on lifetime \\r\\nexpected credit losses are calculated also for an additional category - purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) - \\r\\nregardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of \\r\\nvariable inputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and \\r\\nestimates include: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2;  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 identification of unlikely to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 classification of forbearance and Watch list; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including \\r\\n\\r\\nthe various formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default \\r\\n\\r\\n(LGD) and exposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\uf0b7 determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic \\r\\n\\r\\nand pessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and assigning \\r\\n\\r\\nprobabilities to those scenarios; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe model applied was not changed during the first three quarters of 2020. The macroeconomic parameters were reviewed in \\r\\nthe first and second quarters to reflect the outlook due to COVID-19.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMore qualitative and quantitative information on an impairment of financial assets in light of COVID-19 is provided in Note 3 \\r\\nGeneral Risk Management Policies. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived \\r\\nfrom active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. \\r\\nThe input to these models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement \\r\\nis required in establishing fair values. For the fair value of financial assets and liabilities refer to Note 17. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required \\r\\nin the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements as \\r\\nat 31 December 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe interim financial statements disclose information on changes directly initiated as part of the bank’s response to the COVID-\\r\\n19 pandemic and additional information about changes implemented during the reporting period not directly related to COVID-\\r\\n19 pandemic in further sections of this note.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMAIN GOALS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of risk management at Luminor is to achieve an optimal balance between the risk of losses and the earnings potential in \\r\\na medium- and long-term perspective.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s Risk Management function consists of the Risk Division and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Risk Division is an \\r\\nindependent control and reporting function authorized to verify that Luminor’s business and supporting divisions operate within \\r\\nthe set risk appetite and risk strategy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe ECB-led Comprehensive Assessment (i.e. both the Asset Quality Review and Stress Test exercise) is currently in progress. \\r\\nThe overall exercise is currently planned to end in December 2020, with join-up process in January 2021 and publication of the \\r\\nresults in February 2021.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 30  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo further facilitate the leveraging of synergies between departments, the Risk Division is reorganized as of 1 October 2020. \\r\\nFunctions performed by the Special Projects Department were merged into other departments within the Risk Division. The new \\r\\norganisational chart can be seen below.   \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Enterprise Risk Department is a centralized centre of expertise and manages risk management tools and processes, which \\r\\nrun across different risk types. The control function for credit risk is under the responsibility of the Credit Risk Department. The \\r\\ncontrol function for operational risk lies under the responsibility of the Operational Risk Department. The Market & Liquidity \\r\\nRisk Department is responsible for market risk and liquidity risk control. The Model Risk & Validation Department owns the \\r\\nmodel risk framework and respective validation activities. The Risk Data & Analytics Department combines most of the activities \\r\\nrelated to data and modelling. The first line of defence tasks previously performed by the Market & Liquidity Risk Department \\r\\nwere extracted into the Markets & Treasury Middle Office, which is planned to be moved out of the Risk Division to the first line \\r\\nof defence.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCREDIT RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures imposed by most of the European countries had an adverse impact on the \\r\\neconomies in the first half of 2020. In particular, the social- and economic constraints imposed by the governments across Europe \\r\\nand also in the Baltic states implied a significant reduction of economic activity in the second quarter of 2020, including \\r\\nbusinesses being almost entirely shut down in certain sectors, and increasing unemployment as a consequence. Since Luminor is \\r\\none of the largest banks in the Baltic region, many of Luminor’s customers were directly or indirectly affected by this situation. \\r\\nWhen the restrictions were gradually lifted, signs of improvement have been observed during the third quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nA key governmental support measure was the moratoria agreements introduced by the European Banking Authority (the EBA) \\r\\nand regulated by the EBA Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria on loan repayments applied in the light of the \\r\\nCOVID-19 pandemic (EBA/GL/2020/02). Luminor Bank AS in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania have joined the \\r\\nindustry-wide private moratoria initiatives in each country, which comply with the EBA/GL/2020/02. The moratoria are \\r\\napplicable for performing COVID-19 affected customers experiencing temporarily financial difficulties, yet had acceptable \\r\\npayment discipline during 12 months leading up to the crisis. The terms of postponements are the following:   \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for individual customers, a grace period on principal payments might be granted up to 12 months for mortgage loans and \\r\\nup to 6 months for consumer credits and leasing agreements; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for business customers with an exposure below 5 million EUR, the period of payment postponement is up to 6 months for \\r\\namortising products. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nAny other conditions shall not be changed, and the grace period can be granted only once. The modifications under the moratoria \\r\\nare not classified as forbearance. For the cases not meeting moratoria conditions, an individual solutions are applied and \\r\\nindividual assessment on the exposure classification is performed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe moratoria were in force until 30 September 2020. For the majority of individual customers’ consumer credits and leasing \\r\\nagreements grace periods already ended in July 2020, for the majority of individual customers’ mortgage loans and business \\r\\ncustomers’ loans the end of grace periods is upcoming in October 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has been monitoring the spread of COVID-19 since early 2020 and has adjusted its risk management to the new \\r\\noperating environment. Customers where deterioration of the credit quality was observed or predicted based on the changed \\r\\noperating environment were included into the Watch list in order to monitor them more thoroughly. A Weekly Early Warning \\r\\nIndicator tracker has been established to enable close monitoring of the changes in the portfolio.

During the first three quarters of 2020 the impairment \\r\\nmethodology remained unchanged. \\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent regulatory authorities had announced various measures to deal with the crisis and minimise the effect on the \\r\\neconomies.

The \\r\\ninternal risk grade and probability of default (PD) of banks is based on the available risk classifications from rating agencies \\r\\nMoody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Luminor a separate dedicated Financial Institutions unit acts as a single core competence center and ensures holistic overview \\r\\nof the Group’s credit limits/exposure on banks and countries. Since March 2020, the Financial Institutions Department has \\r\\nswitched from quarterly to daily portfolio monitoring. A Financial Institutions Risk Forum is organised on a regular basis to \\r\\nfollow-up the latest market developments and review if any changes/restrictions are needed for established credit limits towards \\r\\nbanks and countries.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s portfolio consists of reputable investment grade correspondent banks that have not seen internal credit rating \\r\\ndowngrades during the third quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 36  \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities exposure  (Note 17: except for debt securities - Other financial corporations) of the Group at the end of the third \\r\\nquarter of 2020 was 271 million EUR compared to 211 million EUR at the end of 2019.

The other part consists of level 1 assets (using Liquidity Coverage Ratio terminology), \\r\\nincluding Estonian and Austrian sovereign bonds, and covered bonds issued by French companies. Lithuanian and Estonian \\r\\ncorporate bonds within the trading debt portfolio form the remaining very small part. The average weighted duration of the total \\r\\nportfolio is 4.1 years compared to 3.1 years at the end of 2019. Debt securities investments are performed in accordance with \\r\\nthe limits set by the Luminor’s Management Board and the Supervisory Council.

This includes fostering a sound risk culture in their respective reporting \\r\\nlines to ensure that employees understand the operations that are performed by them, the risks inherent in these, and the \\r\\nimportance of controls they execute or oversee the execution of.   \\r\\n\\r\\nA key objective of the Operational Risk Department is to identify any deviations of Luminor’s operational risk profile from the \\r\\ndesired risk level that is stated in the Risk Appetite Framework, and to do so in a timely manner to ensure any deviations can be \\r\\neffectively managed without significant detriment to the bank, its customers or other stakeholders. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the prevalence and infection rate of COVID-19 fluctuated in the Baltic countries during the third quarter of 2020, Luminor \\r\\nimplemented a system of predefined controls in the form of COVID-19 response states.  These response states allow management \\r\\nto quickly and effectively increase or decrease COVID-19 related restrictions and limitations in response to perceived threat and \\r\\nrisk levels.  The COVID-19 response states are designed as a baseline to manage the risk to Luminor and the bank’s stakeholders, \\r\\nand are country-based.  Should there be a variation between the restrictions in the relevant COVID-19 response state and local \\r\\ngovernmental rules or advice, the more conservative of the two will prevail. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor management is kept updated on the status of operational risk through periodic and ad hoc risk reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nMARKET RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has a low risk appetite for market risk, which is defined as the risk of losses from on- and off-balance sheet positions \\r\\narising from adverse movements in market parameters such as interest rates, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, equity \\r\\nprices or commodity prices. Based on Luminor’s internal risk self-assessment, the most significant parts of the market risk for \\r\\nthe Group are interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange risk, which all stayed well within internal Risk Appetite \\r\\nFramework and lower level limits, while the exposures were at similar levels as they were during the last reporting quarter. The \\r\\nsignificance of other risks is lower, as the Group does not have any open positions in equity instruments for trading, and all \\r\\ncommodity deals with customers are hedged with back-to-back transactions. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the major negative impact to the Group in terms of market risk could arise \\r\\nfrom credit spread risk. This risk is mitigated by limits as well as certain quality requirements for the liquidity bond portfolios. \\r\\nThe Bank follows a rigorous framework for debt securities management. Bond portfolios managed by the Treasury & Asset and \\r\\nLiability Management Department and Markets Department are restricted in terms of size, level of quality, region and \\r\\ncounterparty, limiting credit risk exposure.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe bank measures the stressed spread impact to its liquidity bond portfolio as part of the Risk Appetite Framework applying \\r\\nthe severe adverse shock. Assuming a 100 basis points spread widening towards risk-free alternative investments of matching \\r\\nmaturity profile for A-rated bonds and a 50 basis points spread widening for corresponding AA-rated bonds, the projected \\r\\ndecrease in market value of the bonds would be the following: \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR 30 September 2020 30 June 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket value loss projection due to increase in credit spreads 9 207 7 850 \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations in time, the risk of incurring losses \\r\\ndue to sudden decrease in financial resources (e.g. a financial crisis situation may result in a delay of incoming payments) or an \\r\\nincrease of the price of new resources for refinancing. The consequence of liquidity risk may be failure to meet obligations to \\r\\nrepay depositors and fulfil loan commitments.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed to ensure a constant ability to settle contractual obligations. The Group has developed a set of early \\r\\nwarning indicators and limits for a timely identification of liquidity crises, and business and funding contingency plans to manage \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 38  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Group’s liquidity during market disruptions. The liquidity risk management strategy is reviewed at least annually or after any \\r\\nsignificant change in the internal or external environment the Group operates in.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed across the three lines of defence: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The first line of defence comprises the Group’s Treasury & Asset and Liability Management (TALM) and the business areas. \\r\\nTALM is responsible for the daily liquidity management and funds transfer pricing (FTP). To ensure the funding in \\r\\nsituations where Luminor is in urgent need of cash and the normal funding sources do not suffice, Luminor holds a liquidity \\r\\nbuffer that consists of Central Bank cash and high quality securities that can be readily sold or used as collateral for funding \\r\\noperations;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Market and Liquidity Risk Department is the second line of defence and is responsible for providing independent oversight \\r\\nand control of liquidity risk and the first line of defence; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The Internal Audit function is the third line of defence, which is responsible for providing independent assurance over the \\r\\nfirst and second lines of defence activities. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLiquidity risk management has a focus on short term obligations and more structural long-term liquidity risk applying different \\r\\ninternal and external metrics. he Group uses a range of liquidity metrics for measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk \\r\\nincluding the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), internal liquidity limits and trigger events, \\r\\nand the survival horizon metric as part of a liquidity stress testing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of intraday and short-term liquidity management is to meet the daily need for funds to ensure compliance with the \\r\\nreserve and liquidity requirements set by the ECB, as well as compliance with internal liquidity limits. Short-term liquidity is \\r\\nmaintained through the daily monitoring of the liquidity status, day-to-day funding and trading the appropriate financial \\r\\ninstruments for liquidity purposes. Long-term liquidity risk management is supported by analysing the estimated future cash \\r\\nflows considering deposit and loan portfolio growth, as well as possible refinancing sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of liquidity risk assessment, the liquidity gap is analysed considering the maturity of cash flows. The liquidity \\r\\nrisk is restricted by imposing internal limits on the liquidity gap. Utilisation of this limit is subject to regular monitoring and \\r\\nreporting to management bodies in the Group. The liquidity gap is calculated by analysing the Group’s net refinancing situation \\r\\nwithin one week, one month and three months applying a \"business as usual\" approach. Liquid assets and short-term liabilities \\r\\nare included in liquidity gap calculations for respective terms (1 week to 3 months). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe LCR is calculated as the ratio of a credit institution’s liquidity buffer to its net liquidity outflows over a 30-calendar-day stress \\r\\nperiod and is expressed as a percentage. The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of the Group’s liquidity risk \\r\\nprofile and requires the holding of risk-free assets that may be easily liquidated to meet required payments for outflows net of \\r\\ninflows during a thirty-day crisis period without support from the central bank. The minimum regulatory limit of LCR is set at \\r\\n100%, however the Group has a substantial buffer over it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe NSFR is defined as the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding over a one-year \\r\\ntime horizon. The minimum requirement for NSFR is 100%, however the Group has a substantial buffer and maintains a higher \\r\\nratio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has set the limits in place for various measures, including LCR, NSFR, liquidity gaps, and manages those within the set \\r\\nlimits by ensuring the proper maturity structure of its assets and liabilities, for example, via issuing long dated debt.

Accounts where the Group held EUR 3.7 billion at the end of \\r\\nSeptember 2020. This buffer can be utilized at any time when the need arises. On top of the Central Bank Accounts, the buffer \\r\\nincludes also the bond portfolio of EUR 276.3 million consisting mainly of government debt securities.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity buffer is supported by the contractual agreement for funding with shareholders DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank \\r\\nAbp. This strongly mitigates the likelihood of funding liquidity risk, which may be caused by deposit run off, wholesale funding \\r\\nrisk (roll over and new issuance), unexpected outflows from off-balance sheet obligations and legal risks (e.g. not being able to \\r\\nissue funding due to legal restrictions). This agreement introduces the requirement for collateral as the facility is collateralized \\r\\nwith assets, primarily with mortgages. Other funding sources requiring collateral are covered bonds and TLTRO. The \\r\\nencumbrance arising from pledged assets is reported and monitored. The collateral is managed by monitoring the fulfillment of \\r\\nthe requirements for each type of collateral. \\r\\n\\r\\nSurvival horizon \\r\\n\\r\\nThe key metric for liquidity risk appetite set in the Risk Appetite Framework is the survival horizon analysed across different \\r\\nstress scenarios. The survival horizon is defined as a period with a positive cumulative cash flow. It is used to capture the liquidity \\r\\nbuffer available outright to be used in liquidity stress situations within 12 months. The outcome of liquidity stress testing is the \\r\\nnumber of days the Group can withstand a liquidity crisis considering Luminor’s mitigating capacity, for example the liquidity \\r\\nbuffer. \\r\\n\\r\\nThree different scenarios are considered while measuring the survival horizon: bank-specific, market-wide and the combination \\r\\nof the most severe assumptions from the previous two. Stress testing assumptions include but are not limited to severe deposit \\r\\nwithdrawals, including early termination of term deposits and run-off of top 5 depositors, deterioration of financial assets, \\r\\ndecrease of loan repayment levels, increase of utilization of credit commitments, as well as limited availability of credit lines from \\r\\nshareholders based on the existing Facility Agreement. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity buffer for the survival horizon metric is strongly affected by the assumption of outgoing deposits in the first few \\r\\ndays and weeks of the turbulence period, with the smaller continuous run-off occurring in the following months. Due to rather \\r\\nhigh concentration of top depositors, the Group tests resistance towards a run-off of the 5 largest depositors as well. Total funds \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 43  \\r\\n\\r\\nof the top 5 largest depositors amounted to 1 884 million EUR at the end of the third quarter of 2020 compared to 1 347 million \\r\\nEUR at the end of 2019. Despite that the Group has sufficient liquidity and can survive for longer than 1 year period without any \\r\\nadditional support. On top of that, Luminor has substantial unused credit line from shareholders which can be utilized at any \\r\\ntime based on the mutual Facility Agreement. Furthermore, the majority of liquid buffer consists of cash held within central banks \\r\\nand highly liquid debt securities which substantially softens the consequences of deteriorating liquidity in case of high outflows.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s liquidity situation is sufficiently strong to survive severe external \\r\\nshocks. \\r\\n\\r\\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s regulatory capital consists fully of Tier 1/Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Tier1/CET1 capital consists of \\r\\nordinary shares, share premium, mandatory reserve, retained earnings of the previous financial year, the audited profit of the \\r\\ncurrent financial year and less the intangible assets, deferred tax assets, revaluation profit of investment properties, current year \\r\\nlosses, if any, and other deductions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital is calculated and allocated for risk coverage following the regulations in the CRD IV and CRR of the EU and the \\r\\napplicable regulatory requirements. The Group’s objectives in capital management are as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 consistency with Luminor Group’s long-term strategy (including meeting the risk appetite of the Group) and the Dividend \\r\\npolicy; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 the ability to pursue the business objectives; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 fulfilment of both internal and external capitalisation targets (capital adequacy); \\r\\n\\uf0b7 sufficient and proper composition of capital that would withstand stressful events. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe capital adequacy assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in accordance with the information guidelines for the risk \\r\\nmanagement and capital adequacy disclosure (Pillar 3) report.  \\r\\n\\r\\nQuantitative information regarding the capital managed by the Group is presented below: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nAccording to the prudential requirements, the Pillar 2 requirement set by the ECB in the 2019 Joint Decision on Capital and the \\r\\nSystemic risk and Countercyclical risk buffer requirements set by the Central Banks of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, Luminor \\r\\nGroup is required to hold capital exceeding 10.1% CET1 and 14.5% Total capital.

The Group does not apply any Value at Risk (VaR) or other internal models for the calculation \\r\\nof the market risk capital requirement and applies the Basic Indicators Approach for calculating the operational risk capital \\r\\nrequirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk-weighted assets are measured by means of risk weights classified according to the nature of each asset and counterparty, \\r\\ntaking into account the collaterals and guarantees eligible for risk mitigation. A similar treatment with some adjustments is \\r\\nadopted for the off-balance sheet exposures. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group reviews and improves the risk identification and management policies and procedures according to changes in the \\r\\nGroup’s activities and financial situation at least once a year. Amendments and updates are mostly done during the annual \\r\\ninternal capital adequacy assessment process when significant risks are to be reassessed or identified and assessed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group complied with all externally imposed capital requirements during the reporting period. \\r\\n\\r\\nGOING CONCERN \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor’s management is fully convinced of a stable and balanced performance going forward and, based on that, prepared \\r\\nthese financial statements on a going concern basis. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 45  \\r\\n\\r\\n4.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where \\r\\nthe fair values of financial assets and liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active \\r\\nmarkets, they are determined in a way that unobservable inputs used to measure fair value would reflect the assumptions that \\r\\nmarket participants would use when pricing assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risk. Where observable \\r\\nmarket data is not available, expert judgment is required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements, \\r\\nthe above mentioned techniques related to unobservable inputs were not used as no such financial assets and liabilities exist on \\r\\nthe statement of financial position of the Group.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTISED COSTS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR  \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value \\r\\n\\r\\n30 September 2020 30 September 2020 31 December 2019 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortised cost         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 3 988 921 3 988 921 2 924 019 2 924 019 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 97 625 97 625 141 645 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 9 626 948 9 302 750 10 222 547 10 324 772 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 13 713 494 13 389 296 13 288 211 13 390 436 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities       \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost       \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n120 152 120 152 980 692 980 692 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 11 070 312 11 070 312 10 235 443 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 1 163 485 1 161 993 651 716 653 967 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 31 146 31 146 45 303 45 303 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 12 385 095 12 383 603 11 913 154 11 915 405 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 53  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarises the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities. Financial \\r\\ninstruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value:  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the \\r\\nmeasurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and shall be used \\r\\nwithout adjustment to measure fair value whenever available; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Level 2 — valuation techniques for which inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 are observable for the \\r\\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must \\r\\nbe observable for a substantial part of the term of the asset or liability; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Level 3 — valuation techniques for which inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be \\r\\nused to measure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations \\r\\nin which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value \\r\\nmeasurement objective remains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market \\r\\nparticipant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs shall reflect the assumptions that \\r\\nmarket participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 54  \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 30 September 2020 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using \\r\\n \\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 3 988 921 0 0 3 988 921 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 97 573 52 0 97 625 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 9 302 750 9 302 750 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial assets 0 0 9 970 9 970 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading     \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 5 272 0 0 5 272 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss     \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 2 523 0 2 523 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities     \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Goverments 246 936 0 0 246 936 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 24 062 0 0 24 062 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial corporations 0 0 13 688 13 688 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments     \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 49 632 686 50 318 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive \\r\\nincome \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 140 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  4 362 764 52 207 9 327 234 13 742 205 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are disclosed     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 88 252 31 900 0 120 152 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 9 598 620 1 471 692 11 070 312 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 498 919 663 074 0 1 161 993 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 31 146 31 146 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value     \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments     \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 47 994 1 359 49 353 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  587 171 10 341 588 1 504 197 12 432 956 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 55  \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 31 December 2019 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using \\r\\n \\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 2 924 019 0 0 2 924 019 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 141 596 49 0 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 10 324 772 10 324 772 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial assets 0  0 29 113 29 113 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value         \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading         \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 3 021 0 0 3 021 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss         \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 4 033 0 4 033 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities         \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Goverments 195 989 0 0 195 989 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 15 023 0 0 15 023 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial corporations 0 0 12 851 12 851 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments         \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 58 087 1 130 59 217 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive \\r\\nincome \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 140 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  3 279 648 62 169 10 368 006 13 709 823 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities         \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are disclosed         \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 29 080 951 612 0 980 692 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 8 074 410 2 161 033 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 653 967 0 653 967 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 45 303 45 303 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value         \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments         \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 56 042 2 262 58 304 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  29 080 9 736 031 2 208 598 11 973 709 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Non-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss (Pension Funds) -

Pension fund units are revalued according to the effective net \\r\\nasset value on the balance sheet date;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Cash and cash balances with central banks – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at \\r\\nthe same price in an orderly transaction;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Due from other credit institutions – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at the same \\r\\nprice in an orderly transaction. Due from other credit institutions are demand deposits;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Loans to customers – fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows with the loan portfolio \\r\\naverage rate which was calculated based on the Bank new sales margin of the third quarter of 2020 and total volume of \\r\\nthe loan portfolio that included  credit risk factors. Same valuation technique is applied to all loan classes and accordingly \\r\\nall loan classes are classified under fair value level 3. As at 31 December 2019 fair value was estimated by discounting \\r\\nestimated future cash flows with the base curve used by the Bank (6m Euribor curve as average for all loans) as adjusted \\r\\nby credit riks factors; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (debt securities) - for domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic \\r\\nstates, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish \\r\\nthe trading offers in the form of prices, yields or equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the \\r\\naverage of bid prices shall be used taking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic \\r\\nstates, or there are no quotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers \\r\\nare clearly incorrect or artificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data using \\r\\nsources like Bloomberg or similar; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the interest \\r\\nrates for items with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured using the assumptions \\r\\nthat market participants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best \\r\\ninterest;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (equities, debt securities):  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source for local equities. These are securities \\r\\nfor which active market exists based on the turnover, meaning availability of quotes at which market \\r\\nparticipants transact in the local stock market. The quotes of foreign equities shall be taken from Bloomberg \\r\\ngiving the priority to the primary market, and then to the country of issuer if the active market exists there. \\r\\nOtherwise, the market with the highest liquidity (turnover) shall be used as a source for pricing. If the quotes \\r\\nin primary data sources are clearly incorrect or artificial, the price of particular equity shall be derived from \\r\\nliquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or similar. Correctness of the quotes described above are the \\r\\nsubject of expert judgment of the Market & Liquidity Risk Department member together with the Bank’s \\r\\nMarkets Department’s dealer responsible for equity trading. For equities of non-listed companies for which \\r\\nactive market does not exist, any available trusted public information on recent trades shall be used for the \\r\\npricing of the equity. Alternatively, dividend discount model shall be used to determine the price of equity. \\r\\nExpert opinion based on other available related market data shall be used for pricing of equity if the previously \\r\\ndescribed methods are not possible;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 For domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be \\r\\nthe priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading offers in the form of prices, yields \\r\\nor equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid prices shall be used \\r\\ntaking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no \\r\\nquotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are \\r\\nclearly incorrect or artificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data \\r\\nusing sources like Bloomberg or similar;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Derivative financial instruments – market data from financial data vendors, electronic trading platforms or third-party \\r\\nvaluation are used for valuation purposes. The derivatives represent non-complex products valued with generally \\r\\naccepted models. Valuation inputs are derived from the market data;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Loans and deposits from credit institutions – the fair value of loans equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the loans from \\r\\ncredit institutions is under market conditions. Expected cash flows of the liabilities from the banks are discounted with \\r\\nthe same market rates as loans. Loans from credit institutions are long-term. Deposits from credit institutions are demand \\r\\ndeposits. The fair value of deposits equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the deposits from credit institutions is under \\r\\nmarket conditions;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 57  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Deposits from customers – the gross carrying amount of demand deposits as a fair value is applied as an approximation \\r\\ndue to very short maturities;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Debt securities issued – Covered bonds are actively traded on market\\u202fusing the market rate yield curve (swap curve) \\r\\nprovided by Bloomberg. The fair value of\\u202fcovered bonds issued by the Bank is calculated\\u202fin a similar way as for actively \\r\\ntraded covered bonds i.e.\\u202fusing spread level based on the existing bond and prevailing market level. The debt securities \\r\\nissued by the Bank are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortized \\r\\ncost using effective interest rate (EIR) method. The fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows using the \\r\\nmarket interest rate yield curve. Covered bonds are classified as Level 1 as they are actively traded on market using the \\r\\nmarket rate yield curve (swaps curve) provided by Bloomberg. \\r\\n\\r\\n18.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by the IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as the Management Board. The \\r\\nManagement Board monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about \\r\\nresource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit before tax and is measured \\r\\nconsistently with profit before tax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of expenses after \\r\\ninternal funds transfer pricing, as management primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a \\r\\nperformance measure. Fees and commission income for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made \\r\\nbetween different product categories for segment reporting.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth \\r\\nManagement. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. \\r\\nCorporate Banking segment services business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager and all leasing customers \\r\\nwho do not have a bank relationship. Retail Banking segment services business customers without a dedicated relationship \\r\\nmanager and private individuals not belonging to Wealth Management segment. Wealth Management services wealthy private \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 59  \\r\\n\\r\\nindividuals and holding companies associated with those individuals. Results of other operating segments are included in Other \\r\\nsegment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments \\r\\n(including internal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Other segment) and income and expenses not \\r\\nbooked on customer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using internally agreed allocation mechanisms. \\r\\nOnly assets and liabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating segments are reported under the respective \\r\\nsegments, all other balance sheet items are not reported under the operating segments to CODM. Loans and Deposits are reported \\r\\nunder operating segments at Gross amounts (and excluding accrued interest). Net impairment (losses/reversal) on loans to \\r\\ncustomers is monitored for each of the segments at Profit or Loss side, while at the Assets side, the CODM only monitors Gross \\r\\namounts of Loans to customers, with impairment allowances not being allocated to operating segments. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first quarter of 2020 it was decided to transfer customers with leasing exposures but without a relationship to bank \\r\\nentities from Other segment to Corporate segment and restatement was made also to historic periods. From the first quarter of \\r\\n2020 Luminor started applying Activity Based Costing to allocate personnel costs, administrative costs and depreciation between \\r\\noperating segments and restatement was also made to segment split of costs to 2019 figures. The asymmetrical allocation of \\r\\nallowance for impairment Net impairment (losses/reversal) on loans to customers, as described above, was applied from the \\r\\nsecond quarter of 2020. Comparative information for Loans and Advances as of 31 December 2019 was changed accordingly. \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Corporate Retail \\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement \\r\\nOther Total

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD \\r\\n\\r\\nJonas Eriksson resigned as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Member of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS effective \\r\\n10 October 2020. The bank announced Eriksson’s decision to resign on 17 August 2020. The Supervisory Council of the bank \\r\\nhas commenced a comprehensive search process for a new CFO. Until a new CFO is appointed, Erkki Raasuke, Chairman of the \\r\\nManagement Board, will oversee responsibility for the bank’s finance function at the Management Board level, supported by \\r\\nOlof Sundblad, Head of Treasury, who will be acting CFO during the interim period. \\r\\n\\r\\nEffective 1 October 2020 the Wealth Management Division was merged with the Retail Banking Division under its current \\r\\nmanagement. Segment reporting will be adjusted for this change in the fourth quarter of 2020 interim report, including \\r\\nrestatement for historic periods. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 62  \\r\\n\\r\\nBetween the end of the third quarter and the reporting date, Luminor exited one credit.

As in first half of the year, we looked after the well-being of our \\r\\nstaff and supported our customers. Despite the pandemic we made continued progress with our existing strategy and look \\r\\nforward confidently to growing our business in the period ahead, with a strong balance sheet, increasing efficiency and a unique \\r\\nposition. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs COVID-19 once again effected our home markets, loans to customers fell in the quarter while deposits from customers \\r\\nincreased, leading to a loans-to-deposits ratio of 80% at quarter end. Meanwhile we managed down our portfolio of non-\\r\\nperforming loans. We finished the quarter with non-performing loans equal to 3.2% of gross loans. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe completed the technology carve-out from our former parent banks. Following the migration of Luminor customers to our \\r\\ncommon banking platforms in Latvia and Lithuania earlier in the year, we migrated all our existing Estonian customers to the \\r\\nnew banking platform in Estonia in November. At the beginning of 2021, Luminor and IBM announced a new five-year \\r\\nagreement, under which IBM will support Luminor in accelerating our digital transformation and strengthening further our \\r\\nsecurity and regulatory compliance processes.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOur funding efficiency was improved further by the sale of a 300 million EUR bond and concurrent repurchase of 250 million \\r\\nEUR of an existing security due in 2021. This was an important step to meet our future regulatory requirements, which \\r\\nenhanced our liability structure, and deepened our investor base.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn December, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) issued a guarantee to Luminor to \\r\\nsupport additional lending of at least 660 million to small and medium-sized enterprises and Mid-Caps in the Baltics, and help \\r\\nmitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Luminor is the first bank in the Baltics to agree such a guarantee structure through a synthetic \\r\\nsecuritisation transaction between the bank and the EIB Group with support from the Investment Plan for Europe.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is continuously committed to preventing and detecting money laundering and financial crime. In the fourth quarter, \\r\\nLuminor continued to invest in our human and technological capabilities, and to review our systems and processes, so we can \\r\\nadapt in a constantly changing environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic economies have proven very resilient through the pandemic and are well equipped to face future challenges. Luminor \\r\\nwill continue to be a trusted banking partner for individuals and businesses throughout the Baltics. I look forward to leading \\r\\nLuminor as we begin the next phase of our strategy. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nPeter Bosek \\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 4  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral information \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor) was established on 1 October 2017 through the merger of the Baltic operations of DNB Bank ASA \\r\\n(Commercial Register no. 984 851 006, DNB) and Nordea Bank Abp (Commercial Register no. 2858394-9, Nordea) to create a \\r\\nnew-generation financial service provider for local businesses and financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 it was announced that the transaction signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB, Nordea and US-\\r\\nbased private equity firm Blackstone had been concluded and as a result a consortium led by private equity funds managed by \\r\\nBlackstone acquired a 60.1% majority stake in the bank. The bank’s initial owners Nordea and DNB each retained a 19.95% \\r\\nequity stake in Luminor, but an arrangement has been made by the consortium and Nordea for the purchase of Nordea’s \\r\\nremaining stake over the coming years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with some 900 000 clients, 2 378 employees, and market \\r\\nshare of 16.1% in deposits and 17.2% in lending as at the end of December 2020. Luminor has total shareholders’ equity of 1.7 \\r\\nbillion EUR and it is capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 22.4%. Luminor’s core business is serving entrepreneurial people in the \\r\\nBaltics with a primary focus on local companies and the financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers its customers a wide range of products and services through all possible channels, digital and physical, with 29 \\r\\ncustomer service centres in total in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, of which seven are meet-up points. Luminor owns 363 ATMs \\r\\nthroughout the Baltic states, and additionally provides services through 100 ATMs in partnership with other financial services \\r\\nproviders.  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Estonia Latvia Lithuania Total  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of customers ~128 000 ~218 000 ~544 000 ~891 000 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket shares      \\r\\n\\r\\nLending 11.7% 22.1% 19.7% 17.2% \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits 8.6% 16.0% 21.7% 16.1% \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of client service \\r\\ncentres, including meet- \\r\\nup points \\r\\n\\r\\n8 9 12 29  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of employees 594 823 961 2 378 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview \\r\\n\\r\\nThe effects of COVID-19 dominated the economies of the Baltic countries in 2020. The notable rebound, from the impact of the \\r\\ninitial lockdown, observed in the third quarter was led by consumers, but exports and investments also staged a significant \\r\\ncomeback. The retail trade continued to be strong into year-end, reflecting the resilience of consumers.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is still a long way to go before a broad-based recovery is achieved, with the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak \\r\\nbringing along new lockdowns across the Baltics These renewed lockdowns are expected to result in another decline in activity \\r\\nin the fourth quarter. However, the setbacks to the region and have been more limited as compared to the full lockdown and \\r\\nthe global contraction in trade in the spring.   \\r\\n\\r\\nIndustrial production has recovered partially. December marked the sixth consecutive month of expansion for euro area \\r\\nmanufacturing despite the headwinds from the virus. Production volumes in the Baltic economies were close to their pre-crisis \\r\\nlevels. Industrial production was up in October by 1% over the year in Estonia and 1.6% in Lithuania, and down by 1.1% in \\r\\nLatvia. In contrast production volumes in the euro area were down 3.8%. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is pent-up demand in the Baltic area, where savings grew strongly. Despite the near-term setback from the resurgence of \\r\\nthe coronavirus, the development of vaccines has given greater confidence to the assumption that the health crisis will be \\r\\nresolved gradually throughout 2021 and into 2022, which in turn will enable economies to return to normal.    \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 5  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe impact of COVID-19 on Luminor \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter we continued to apply all measures needed to look after the safety and well-being of our staff and \\r\\ncustomers in the face of COVID-19. These include encouraging remote working, paying extra attention to cleaning and the \\r\\nincreasing the availability of disinfectants in our premises, and providing protective equipment to our customer-facing \\r\\nemployees.    \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also continued our efforts to promote remote services. We introduced a system of pre-booked visits in our customer service \\r\\ncentres to minimise physical contacts and so safeguard against the pandemic. Employees are informed regularly about \\r\\nprevailing guidelines, restrictions, and recommendations to keep themselves and their customers safe and prevent the spread \\r\\nof the virus. \\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the pandemic Luminor has supported its customers when needed. Further details of this support can be found in \\r\\n‘Asset Quality for Q4 2020’, below, and Note 3 to the Financial Statements, ‘General Risk management Policies’. \\r\\n\\r\\nBusiness development \\r\\n\\r\\nThe transformation of Luminor continued successfully in the fourth quarter. The main efforts were directed towards finalising \\r\\nthe technology carve-out from parent banks.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new banking platform in Estonia was launched in October, after which all the existing customers, over 100 000 in total, \\r\\nwere migrated over the last weekend in November. The legacy platform was shut down in December and the carve-out in \\r\\nEstonia was completed by the end of the year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe successful carve-out in Estonia was the last of Luminor’s customer migrations in the Baltics. Since the end of November \\r\\n2020, we have been operating technology platforms that are fully independent of the systems of either DNB or Nordea.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEntering 2021, Luminor is ready for the next stage of the transformation. We will strengthen our focus on further improving \\r\\ncustomer satisfaction and accelerating our digital development and growth.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we continued to improve our remote customer onboarding capabilities and to scale our marketing \\r\\nactivities targeted at new customer acquisition. The lockdowns and restrictions imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic \\r\\nfurther boosted customer preference for remote digital onboarding. As the result, the share of remotely onboarded customers \\r\\ngrew to 40%, and we expect the upward trend to continue into 2021. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe also continued scaling our sales of the new products and services that we had launched earlier in the year. In the fourth \\r\\nquarter of 2020, we doubled the number of new Black Credit Cards issued to customers, and we tripled the turnover of \\r\\ntransactions through the Luminor E-Commerce Gateway. Assets under management in the Luminor Investor platform \\r\\nincreased by 40% over the quarter, and we have strengthened the platform with new features, giving it fully digital onboarding, \\r\\ninstant cash transfers and a simpler sign-in process.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe brand new internet bank and digital channels were launched in the fourth quarter for Luminor customers in Estonia, and \\r\\nthey are designed to be more user-friendly and give an intuitive experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe volume of deposits in the Retail Banking segment increased by 387 million EUR in the fourth quarter of 2020, which was \\r\\nsignificantly more than the growth of 259 million EUR in the same period last year. \\r\\n\\r\\nMajor efforts were made in the fourth quarter by the Retail Banking team to support the migration of 100 000 customers to the \\r\\nnew channels in Estonia at the end of the year. Several changes were introduced to ensure support and availability for our \\r\\ncustomers, and they included expanding the Call Centre team during the migration period, doing extensive communications \\r\\nwork, and introducing the Change Ambassadors initiative.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe overall focus of Retail Banking in the fourth quarter remained centred on mortgage loans, consumer loans and new \\r\\ncustomer acquisition.   \\r\\n\\r\\nCustomer interest in mortgage lending in the fourth quarter was even greater than before the pandemic. The total volume of \\r\\ntransactions in the real estate market for private individuals was the largest in recent years despite the impact of COVID-19 in \\r\\nall three Baltic markets. More and more clients preferred Luminor as their financial adviser and partner for a mortgage, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 6  \\r\\n\\r\\nresulting in 55% growth in mortgages in the fourth quarter from the third. We have adapted to changing customer needs by \\r\\ncontinuously improving our advisory process, risk evaluation and offers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe demand for consumer loans was squeezed strongly by the COVID-19 restrictions on shopping, travel and other areas of \\r\\nspending. The result was that new sales volumes were 1.52 million EUR smaller in the fourth quarter than in the previous \\r\\nquarter. There were also more applicants whose income had been affected by the pandemic, and the bank advised such \\r\\ncustomers to wait for the situation to stabilise. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team also continued to consolidate its distribution channels during the fourth quarter and improve \\r\\nefficiency in related areas. At the end of the fourth quarter, Luminor was serving its customers in a total of 29 locations across \\r\\nthe Baltics, of which seven are meet-up points.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPension assets grew to 1.6 billion EUR, which was 10.1% more than a year earlier and 7.4% more than in the third quarter. By \\r\\nthe end of the year, Luminor had some 284 000 second pillar pension customers and 63 700 third pillar pension customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fourth quarter of 2020 was the turning point when the focus of the Private Banking segment switched from savings towards \\r\\ngrowing investment volumes in an environment of low margins. Investment assets were up 17% on the same quarter of 2019. \\r\\nThe Luminor Investor platform is a preferred solution that is gaining increasing interest from customers of Private Banking. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe corporate banking lending book contracted in the fourth quarter by 208 million EUR.  This was primarily because of the \\r\\nseasonal amortisation of the overdrafts of agricultural wholesalers and a decrease in the non-performing portfolio. The \\r\\ninvestment lending portfolio was stable.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit volumes increased by a further 344 million EUR on the back of large increases in public sector deposits even though \\r\\nnegative rates were introduced for major accounts. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn December, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) issued a guarantee to Luminor to \\r\\nsupport additional lending to small and medium-sized enterprises and Mid-Caps in the Baltics and help mitigate the impacts of \\r\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The guarantee structure can support at least 660 million EUR of additional loans and leases to SMEs \\r\\nand Mid-Caps in all three Baltic countries through a synthetic securitisation transaction between the bank and the EIB Group \\r\\nwith a support from the Investment Plan for Europe. Luminor is the first bank in the Baltics to use such facility. \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe safety and well-being of Luminor employees and customers continued to be the top priority in the fourth quarter of 2020 \\r\\nin all the bank’s activities, as comprehensive measures were continuously applied to ensure the safety of both employees and \\r\\ncustomers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nContinuous work was done to address issues of Environmental Social Governance (ESG) in a comprehensive way. A separate \\r\\nESG strategy was written in the fourth quarter for 2021-2023, outlining the Luminor stance towards ESG and detailing the \\r\\nproposed strategy, including a roadmap for organisational and programme governance. The strategy covers the \\r\\nrecommendations that are generally recognised in addressing topics of ESG, particularly climate change and the environment, \\r\\nbusiness strategy and models, a risk management framework, governance, and disclosures and reporting.  \\r\\n\\r\\nA new Head of Investor Relations and Sustainable Finance joined Luminor’s Treasury team from October. An inter-divisional \\r\\npermanent ESG working group was set up as well, to ensure that there is sufficient focus and coordination on environmental \\r\\nand social topics in all the divisions of the organisation. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo enhance work-life balance and to further the focus on employee well-being, a Work Environment and Wellbeing Unit was \\r\\nestablished in the structure of the People & Culture division in the fourth quarter. A company-wide approach was taken where \\r\\nemployees were strongly encouraged and enabled to use their vacation time during the holidays at the end of the year. \\r\\n\\r\\nContinued efforts were made to promote financial literacy and cyber security to the public, including raising awareness about \\r\\nsafe online shopping and how to guard against fraudsters. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo support regional business, the best local entrepreneurs were given recognition with the Luminor Development Leap Award \\r\\nin Estonia, which gave the winner the opportunity for a consultation with Luminor’s top managers in the field of their choice. \\r\\nContinuous support was given to local business in Latvia by providing and promoting an online platform for local crafts workers, \\r\\nartisans and small businesses. \\r\\n\\r\\nA Luminor scholarship was granted to an Estonian student for doctoral studies at the University of Cambridge to research the \\r\\nearly signs of Alzheimer’s disease.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 7  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn December, Luminor made a donation to give Christmas gifts to the community. The Christmas donation was used to buy \\r\\ncomputers for families with many children to support distance learning in Estonia, to support the victims of violence in Latvia, \\r\\nand to support a volunteer youth line providing emotional aid in Lithuania. \\r\\n\\r\\nEFFORTS TO PREVENT FINANCIAL CRIME  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor remains vigilant about financial crime and is committed to preventing and detecting it. We continue to review our anti-\\r\\nfinancial crime (AFC) practices regularly and invest in the human and technological resources that are needed. We work \\r\\nconstantly to get a better understanding of our customers and their transactions, and to manage and report any potential \\r\\nfinancial crime risk. Luminor predominantly serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers who have a strong \\r\\npersonal or business connection to the Baltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, Luminor continued to apply its financial crime risk management framework in order to \\r\\nprevent, detect, manage and report potential financial crime, and this was supported by its conservative approach towards \\r\\nmoney laundering and financial crime. The framework covers the technology, policies and procedures employed to detect \\r\\nfinancial crime, assess risks, run training and awareness-raising, and monitor new and developing financial crime risks \\r\\ncontinuously.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is subject to a wide range of legal requirements, and so we are transparent in all our activities and we work closely \\r\\nwith all the supervisory and regulatory authorities. Luminor also follows the international guidelines, recommendations and \\r\\nstandards issued by the regulatory and supervisory authorities, international bodies, local banking associations, and financial \\r\\nintelligence units in each Baltic state.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to invest in systems and processes so we can adapt in a constantly changing environment. The bank is \\r\\nfurther developing its common monitoring and screening solution in all three Baltic states and has approved several further \\r\\ndevelopments that will be delivered during 2021. The developments are directed to further enhancements of monitoring \\r\\nactivities. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor considers that work to raise awareness is an important component of the financial crime risk management framework. \\r\\nIn the fourth quarter, 9 training events related to AFC and corporate compliance areas were held.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is also contributing to general AML efforts by participating in a pilot programme AML Bridge which has been launched \\r\\njointly with an AML start-up, the largest banks in Estonia, and related state authorities.  The aim of this pilot is to promote \\r\\ncollaborative crime-fighting in the banking industry and enhance the efficient use of data in AML efforts. The results of the pilot \\r\\nwill be announced in spring 2021. In Lithuania, Luminor is participating in the establishment of AML Competences Centre. The \\r\\nnew establishment will enhance cooperation between financial institutions and authorities, will improve information sharing \\r\\namong private and public sector, and will be an additional tool for Luminor in the fight against financial crime. \\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER EVENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nEffective 1 October 2020 the Wealth Management Division was merged with the Retail Banking Division under its current \\r\\nmanagement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nJonas Eriksson resigned as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Member of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS effective \\r\\n10 October 2020. The bank announced Eriksson’s decision to resign on 17 August 2020. The Supervisory Council of the bank \\r\\nhas commenced a comprehensive search process for a new CFO. Until a new CFO is appointed, Peter Bosek, Chairman of the \\r\\nManagement Board, will oversee responsibility for the bank’s finance function at the Management Board level, supported by \\r\\nOlof Sundblad, Head of Treasury, who will be acting CFO during the interim period. \\r\\n\\r\\nBetsy Nelson joined the Supervisory Council of Luminor Bank AS, effective from 1 December 2020.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn December, Luminor sold a 300 million EUR bond issue. In addition, it repurchased 250 million EUR of an existing bond that \\r\\nmature in 2021. The bond, which is rated Baa2 by Moody’s, is listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and was issued under Luminor’s \\r\\nEMTN programme. \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 31 DECEMBER \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 January 2021, Peter Bosek became Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS.   \\r\\n\\r\\nMarilin Pikaro announced her decision to resign as Head of the Compliance Division and Member of the Management Board of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS effective from 5 January 2021. Mari Mõis, Head of the Legal Division, was appointed to take over the position \\r\\nof Chief Compliance Officer from 6 January 2021.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 8  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 January 2021, Luminor Bank and IBM announced a new five-year agreement. Under the agreement Luminor will migrate \\r\\nits IT infrastructure to IBM Cloud for Financial Services. IBM will support Luminor in accelerating its digital transformation and \\r\\nstrengthening further its security and regulatory compliance processes. As part of the agreement, some 200 people from \\r\\nLuminor’s Technology Division will be transferred to IBM. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 March 2021, Luminor Operations Department will be incorporated with the Technology Division.  \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 9  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit in the fourth quarter was 18.6 million EUR, 14.6 million EUR more than in the same quarter of last year. A reduction \\r\\nin net operating income of 12.1 million EUR was more than offset by a 2.9 million EUR reduction in total operating expenses \\r\\nand a net reversal of impairments of 14.2 million EUR as compared to impairments of 11.8 million EUR in the fourth quarter of \\r\\n2019.   \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating income in the fourth quarter was 82.6 million EUR. Net interest income decreased marginally to 57.1 million \\r\\nEUR, with a 5.5 million EUR reduction in interest income being largely balanced by a 5.2 million EUR reduction in interest \\r\\nexpense. Net fee and commission income increased by 2.0 million EUR. A number of one off items, such as recognition of the \\r\\nvalue of shares in VISA, part of the profit from the sale of the headquarters building in Riga and higher gains from trading due \\r\\nto higher USD Libor rates, were included in net other operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019. If these items are excluded \\r\\nfrom the comparison, net other operating income remained at a similar level in the fourth quarter of 2020 as in the fourth \\r\\nquarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses were 75.5 million EUR. Personnel expenses were 4.0 million EUR higher in the fourth quarter of 2020, \\r\\nas prior year reversals were replaced by additional charges. In contrast, Other administrative expenses reduced by 6.9 million \\r\\nEUR.   Exceptional costs, incurred to transform Luminor, were 27.8 million EUR, an increase of 2.1 million EUR compared to the \\r\\nsame period of last year as Luminor continued to invest in regulatory compliance implementation and business re-design.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost-to-income ratio for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 91.4% having been 82.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding \\r\\nexceptional costs, the respective ratios were 57.8% and 55.7%. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor recorded a 14.2 million EUR net reversal of impairments in the quarter. The most important contributor to this result \\r\\nwas an exit from a major non-performing exposure because of which the previously recognised loan loss decreased by 9.0 \\r\\nmillion EUR. In addition, collective provisions decreased due to reduction of portfolio, while there were no new significant loss \\r\\ncases in the quarter. Non-performing loans shrank to 3.2% of the loan portfolio by end of the quarter, lower than the 3.8% as \\r\\nof end of 2019.  Tax expense increased from near zero in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 2.2 million EUR in the fourth quarter this \\r\\nyear, as profit before tax increased and the jurisdiction where profit was generated changed. Profit after tax was 18.6 million \\r\\nEUR which was retained and added to equity. \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity for the fourth quarter was 4.5% in 2020 and 1.0% in 2019. Excluding exceptional costs, the respective ratios \\r\\nwere 10.1% and 6.3%. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal assets rose by 729 million EUR during the quarter. Customer deposits increased by 713 million EUR to 11.8 billion EUR \\r\\nwhile loans to customers decreased by 196 million EUR to 9.4 billion EUR.

Growth has been led by deposits in Lithuania, particularly public sector \\r\\ndeposits, which grew by 66% and individual customer deposits, which grew by 11%. During fourth quarter growth has been \\r\\ndriven by individual and business customers. Luminor’s share of the deposit market in the Baltics fell from 16.6% to 16.1% \\r\\nover the 12 months. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 12  \\r\\n\\r\\nASSET QUALITY FOR Q4 2020   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe quality of the loan portfolio continued to improve. The negative consequences of COVID-19 have been limited to date and \\r\\nhave mostly impacted certain industries and customers, while others have so far almost not been affected.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most severe impact was felt by industries like accommodation and food service activities, tourism, and aviation. Luminor’s \\r\\nexposure towards these sectors is small at 0.7% of the total net lending to customers. A little under a third of the net exposure \\r\\nwithin these affected sectors is classified as Stage 3.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have supported our customers through the pandemic in particular through loan modifications. The most common \\r\\nmodification requested were grace periods for principal payments. Grace periods for principal and interest payments were \\r\\ngranted only under exceptional circumstances, and only for around 1% of all modifications.  The outstanding balance of loans \\r\\nunder modifications decreased from 593 million to 77 million EUR over the fourth quarter. The total amount of modification \\r\\nrequests for mortgage loans reached 22 million EUR during the fourth quarter, which is 5 million EUR more than in the third \\r\\nquarter, but much less than in the second quarter, where modification requests totalled 315 million EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe level of exposures overdue by more than 5 days in the portfolio with modifications after the end of the grace period is \\r\\nslightly higher, by 1 percentage point, than it is in the portfolio without modifications (4.1% vs 3.1%). The level of exposures \\r\\noverdue more than 30 days is the same for the portfolio with modifications after the end of the grace period compared to the \\r\\nportfolio without modifications. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aggregated volume of requests for modifications including grace periods stood at 1.1 billion EUR at the end of the fourth \\r\\nquarter and covered 12% of the total credit portfolio, which is almost the same as at the end of the third quarter. The total value \\r\\nof modifications approved reached almost 1.0 billion EUR at the end of the fourth quarter. From the above mentioned received \\r\\nand approved modification requests grace periods have already expired (are back on normal repayment schedules) for around \\r\\n90% of the modified exposures, and this has not led to any noticeable changes in overdue loans within these exposures that \\r\\nwere under modification measures. The inflow of modification requests has almost stopped already in the third quarter, the \\r\\nonly exception are mortgage loans, where modification requests have somewhat resumed during December 2020, but at much \\r\\nlower levels than during the first lockdown.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s loan loss provisioning resulted in reversals of 14.2 million EUR during the fourth quarter. The increase in individual \\r\\nprovisions for some few larger COVID-19 related exposures and problematic real estate exposure was significantly lower than \\r\\nthe positive effect from the resolution of other legacy non-performing exposures and a reduction in Stage 2 provisions driven \\r\\nby risk profile improvements (such as rating upgrades and exclusion from the Watch-list) and exposure decrease. More \\r\\ninformation is provided in Note 2 Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgments).  \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-performing loans totalled 305.4 million EUR. The share of non-performing loans (NPL ratio) was 3.2% at the end of the \\r\\nfourth quarter, which is 0.5 percentage points lower than in the previous quarter. Even though the COVID-19 driven inflow \\r\\ncontinued in the fourth quarter, the outflow was more than three times the inflow, and this left the volume of non-performing \\r\\nloans at its historically lowest level ever in Luminor. The targets defined in Luminor’s non-performing loans’ strategy have been \\r\\nfulfilled – over a 3 year period, non-performing loans were decreased by more than 500 million EUR. The key drivers for the \\r\\ndecrease in the non-performing portfolio were collection activities including sales of collaterals, sales of claim rights, and write-\\r\\noffs of the amounts remaining after collection activities. The NPL ratio for the mortgage loan portfolio was 2.7%, which \\r\\nrepresents an increase of 0.1 percentage points.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal allowances for expected credit losses on the balance sheet were 136.9 million EUR at the end of the quarter, of which 92.3 \\r\\nmillion EUR were for Stage 3 exposures.    \\r\\n\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report

Luminor has managed to replace the funding from its former parent banks by reducing \\r\\nlending volumes and by improving the funding structure.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit volumes continued to increase during the fourth quarter of 2020. Deposits from customers stood at 11 784 million EUR \\r\\nat the end of the fourth quarter, and at 11 070 million EUR at the end of the third quarter. In addition, the total value of the \\r\\nbonds outstanding under the Euro Medium Term Note or EMTN programme was 1 201 million EUR, with 699 million EUR of \\r\\nsenior unsecured bonds and a five-year 502 million EUR covered bond. Luminor issued a long three-year 300 million EUR senior \\r\\nunsecured bond and tendered 250.7 million EUR (nominal amount) of senior unsecured bonds issued in October 2018. The \\r\\nissuance was well received in the market with a substantial order book from investors from 22 different countries. In November \\r\\n2020 Luminor further increased the issuance capacity of its covered bonds programme by adding a portfolio of Lithuanian \\r\\nmortgage loans to the cover pool. After taking in the Lithuanian assets, the cover pool consists of housing loans from all three \\r\\nBaltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a committed funding facility agreement with its former parent banks, DNB and Nordea, that is provided in the \\r\\nform of a syndicate, with each partner in the syndicate supplying 50% of the funding. At the end of the fourth quarter the total \\r\\nfacility stood at 300 million EUR and was fully undrawn. The total commitment was reduced by 737 million EUR during the \\r\\nfourth quarter following a voluntary cancellation by Luminor. The amount of the facility has been committed for five years from \\r\\n1 October 2019, with an initial commitment for three years and the option for Luminor to extend it by up to two years, and it \\r\\ncan be drawn with maturities of one, two or three years. The facility is partly secured, as Luminor had assigned mortgage loans \\r\\nto it with a carrying value of 294.2 million EUR at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 18  \\r\\n\\r\\nStructure of Liabilities and Equity: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 April 2020 Luminor received its minimum own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) requirement in a decision of the Single \\r\\nResolution Board (the SRB) dated 20 December 2019 that was executed for Luminor by a decision of the Estonian Financial \\r\\nSupervision and Resolution Authority. The MREL decision sets the following MREL requirements for Luminor: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Holding AS (the parent company of Luminor Bank AS) shall comply with the MREL at the consolidated level of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS of 17.28% of total liabilities and own funds at all times, and 11.97% of total liabilities and own funds \\r\\nshall be met with subordinated instruments; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Holding AS shall have a transitional period until 30 June 2022 to comply with these requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 the total MREL ratio stood at 14.9% at the consolidated level of Luminor Bank AS, \\r\\ndown from 15.9% at the end of the third quarter, while 10.8% of total liabilities and own funds were subordinated instruments \\r\\nas at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020, down from 11.3% at the end of the third quarter of 2020. It should be noted that the \\r\\nMREL requirements (set versus Total Liabilities and Own Funds) were set using data as of 31 March 2019, which means the \\r\\ndecision (and thus the MREL requirement) does not consider any subsequent events impacting the capital requirements and thus \\r\\nalso the MREL requirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of \\r\\nBaa1/Prime-2, with a stable outlook. There have been no changes to Luminor’s ratings since then. On 25 September 2020 \\r\\nMoody’s issued an updated credit opinion for Luminor.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 March 2020 Moody’s assigned a definitive Aa1 rating to the mortgage covered bonds issued by Luminor Bank AS under \\r\\nthe Estonian Covered Bonds Act. \\r\\n\\r\\n  LIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s structural liquidity risk is conservative and well-balanced. It is based on metrics that measure liquidity risk and is \\r\\nappropriately adapted to the current economic and regulatory environment. Luminor uses a range of metrics to measure \\r\\nliquidity risk, one of which is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The LCR for Luminor was 195% at the end of the fourth quarter \\r\\nof 2020 and 177% at the end of the third quarter under the definition of the LCR given in the Capital Requirements Regulation \\r\\n(CRR). The ratio continued to increase as the increase in deposits supported the liquidity position of the bank. The liquidity \\r\\nbuffer is composed of highly liquid central-bank-eligible securities and cash. Long-term liquidity risk is measured with the Net \\r\\nStable Funding Ratio (NSFR). Luminor’s NSFR rose to 159% during the fourth quarter of 2020 from 144% at the end of the third \\r\\nquarter. The improvement was driven by the increased deposit base benefiting the Available Stable Funding (AFS) and by the \\r\\ndecrease in the amount of Required Stable Funding (RSF). The RSF was impacted mainly by a reduction of the funding facility \\r\\ncommitment that lowered the amount of encumbered assets. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n274\\r\\n\\r\\n4 618 4 471\\r\\n\\r\\n2 694\\r\\n\\r\\n1201\\r\\n1665\\r\\n\\r\\nAll other Liabilit ies Corporate deposits Retail deposits Public sector\\r\\n\\r\\ndeposits\\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securit ies issued Equity\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 19  \\r\\n\\r\\n Q4 2020 Q3  2020 Q2  2020 Q1 2020 Q4  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 194.7% 177.2% 159.0% 143.7% 149.8% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR 159.0% 143.6% 133.2% 126.0% 123.0% \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are predominantly from residents of the Baltics.

The Risk Exposure Amount \\r\\n(REA) fell to 7 086 million EUR, from 7 969 million EUR on 31 December 2019, mainly because the loan portfolio shrank. As at \\r\\nthe end of the fourth quarter of 2020, Luminor had 1 586 million EUR in own funds and they were fully composed of Common \\r\\nEquity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, meaning the Tier 1 and total capital ratios of Luminor stood at the same level as the CET1 ratio.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with the CRR, fell to 10.2% at the end of the fourth quarter from 10.7% at the end \\r\\nof the third quarter. The fall was driven primarily by the increase in central bank assets that raised the leverage ratio exposure. \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital ratios  \\r\\n\\r\\nPosition Q4  2020 Q3  2020 Q2  2020 Q1 2020 Q4  2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeverage ratio 10.16% 10.71% 11.23% 11.46% 10.88% \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio 22.39% 21.99% 22.04% 20.54% 19.66% \\r\\n\\r\\nT1 capital ratio 22.39% 21.99% 22.04% 20.54% 19.66% \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal capital ratio 22.39% 21.99% 22.04% 20.54% 19.66% \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe prudential requirements, which are the Pillar 2 requirement set by the European Central Bank (the ECB) in the 2019 Joint \\r\\nDecision on Capital, and the Systemic Risk Buffer and Countercyclical Risk Buffer requirements set by the Latvian, Estonian and \\r\\nLithuanian supervisory authorities, obliged Luminor to hold capital exceeding 10.1% of CET1 and 14.5% of Total Capital as at \\r\\n30 September 2020.

The bonus share \\r\\nissue is based on the bank’s interim balance sheet as at 2 January 2019 and involves a partial conversion of share premium in the amount of \\r\\n216 030 920 EUR into share capital. Following the bonus issue, the share capital of the bank has been reduced by the same amount and was \\r\\npaid out to the shareholders in September 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 26  \\r\\n\\r\\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR Notes \\r\\n1 January 2020 to  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2020 \\r\\n1 January 2019 to  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flows from operating activities       \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit before tax   35 767 59 262 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustment for:     \\r\\n\\r\\n-Net impairment (-)/ reversal (+) on loans to customers, excluding off-balance sheet \\r\\ncommitments \\r\\n\\r\\n3 14 510 24 015 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Net impairment (-)/ reversal (+) on off-balance sheet commitments  3 130 -1 038 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Dividend income   -64 -90 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Share of profit from an associate   -392 -1 046 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Loss (+) / profit (-) from foreign currency revaluation   -3 052 -428 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Depreciation, amortisation and impairment   12 096 13 177 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Profit from sale of subsidiaries and associates  0 -8 962 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Other adjustments   535 2 396 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Interest income  4 -273 762 -301 677 \\r\\n\\r\\n-Interest expenses  4 46 832 47 525 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from operations before changes in operating assets/liabilities   -164 400 -166 866 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in operating assets/liabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of lending to customers   763 812 1 260 019 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of other assets   -54 642 -57 529 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (+) / decrease (-) of client deposits 12, 13  1 563 227 -1 796 273 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncrease (-) / decrease (+) of liabilities   -35 785 47 313 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest received   285 105 314 015 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest paid   -54 835 -51 790 \\r\\n\\r\\nIncome tax paid   -13 078 -11 507 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from operating activities   2 453 804 -295 752 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nInvesting activities     \\r\\n\\r\\nAcquisition of property, equipment and intangible assets   -2 974 -9 385 \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from disposal of property, equipment and intangible assets  3 545 5 160 \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from disposals of investment property  1 492 30 138 \\r\\n\\r\\nDividend received   796 1 754 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flow from investing activities   2 859 27 667 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancing activities     \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 14  802 750 298 809 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 27  \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities buy back  -254 912 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayment of principal of parent funding \\r\\n                          \\r\\n\\r\\n12 \\r\\n-1 155 000 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nProceeds from parent funding 12 250 000 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments of principal on leases   -6 162 -5 957 \\r\\n\\r\\nPay-out to the Shareholder  0 -216 031 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash flows from financing activities   -363 324 76 821 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nNet increase (+) / decrease (-) in cash and cash equivalents   1 928 939 -358 130 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period  8,9 2 952 815 3 310 517 \\r\\n\\r\\nEffects of currency translation on cash and cash equivalents   3 052 428 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet increase (+) / decrease (-) in cash and cash equivalents   1 928 939 -358 130 \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period   4 884 806 2 952 815 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash equivalents comprise     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash on hand  8 123 809 140 518 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-restricted current account with central bank  8 4 690 457 2 670 701 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions on demand or with original maturity of three \\r\\nmonths or less \\r\\n\\r\\n 9 70 540 141 596 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal   4 884 806 2 952 815 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 28  \\r\\n\\r\\nNOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL \\r\\nSTATEMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\n1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE INFORMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) is a local credit institution whose parent company is Luminor Holding AS \\r\\nthat is ultimately controlled by BCP VII, an investment fund managed by an affiliate of Blackstone Group Inc. Other shareholders \\r\\nof Luminor Holding AS - Nordea Bank Abp and DNB BANK ASA - are considered to be the entities with significant influence over \\r\\nthe Group. The Luminor Bank’s registered legal address is Liivalaia 45, 10145, Tallinn, Republic of Estonia. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Holding AS, established on 14 May 2019, is the parent company of Luminor Bank AS since 23 September 2019. Until 23 \\r\\nSeptember 2019 the parent company was Luminor Group AB. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor Bank AS has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries \\r\\nthrough the Estonian registered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone acquired a 60.1% majority stake in the \\r\\nLuminor Holding AS, the owner of Luminor Bank AS. Luminor Bank AS previous owners, Nordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB \\r\\nBANK ASA (\"DNB\"), each retained a 19.95% equity stake in the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the current interim report, “Bank” (or Luminor Bank AS) refers to Luminor Bank AS. “Group” refers to the consolidated \\r\\nfinancial statements of Luminor Bank AS and its subsidiaries.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 December 2020 Luminor Bank AS directly or indirectly owned majority in the following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country Republic of \\r\\nEstonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country Republic of Latvia: Registered country Republic of \\r\\nLithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Liising AS  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Pensions Estonia AS \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Promano Estonia OÜ (under \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation)   \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Asset Management IPAS \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Finance SIA (under liquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Līzings SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Realm SIA (under liquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 2 SIA (under liquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 3 SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 4 SIA \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Salvus 6 SIA (under liquidation)  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Trioleta SIA (under liquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Baltic ipasums SIA (under liquidation) \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Investiciju Valdymas \\r\\nUAB \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Luminor Lizingas UAB \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Industrius UAB (under \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Intractus UAB \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Promano Lit UAB (under \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Recurso UAB (under \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidation) \\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 December 2020 Luminor Bank AS had ownership in the following associated companies: \\r\\n\\uf0b7 ALD Automotive AS (25%)  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 ALD Automotive SIA (25%) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 ALD Automotive UAB (25%) \\r\\n\\uf0b7 SIA Kredītinformācijas Birojs (22,61%) \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (Luminor, the Bank or the Group) was prepared \\r\\nin accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU. The condensed consolidated interim financial \\r\\ninformation does not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read \\r\\nin conjunction with the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 29  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are consistent \\r\\nwith those followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019, \\r\\nexcept for the adoption of new standards effective as of 1 January 2020. The Group has not early adopted any standard, \\r\\ninterpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. Several amendments and interpretations apply for the \\r\\nfirst time in 2020, but do not have a material impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS Interpretation Committee agenda decision regarding deferred tax related to investments in subsidiaries \\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Estonia and Latvia have replaced the traditional profit-based tax regimes with distribution-based tax regimes where \\r\\ncorporate income tax is not payable on profit but rather on distribution of dividends. In accordance with IAS 12.52A and 57A, in \\r\\ndistribution-based tax regimes no current or deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of undistributed profits until a liability \\r\\nto pay dividends is recognised. As a market practice in Estonia, this accounting policy has been applied consistently to all \\r\\nundistributed profits in the group, regardless of whether those profits accumulated in the parent or in the subsidiaries. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2020, IFRS Interpretation Committee made an agenda decision where it concluded that the principle set out in IAS 12.52A \\r\\nand 57A only applies to undistributed profits accumulated in the parent company and does not apply to undistributed profits \\r\\naccumulated in the subsidiaries. Instead, the principles described in IAS 12.39-40 should be followed in respect of undistributed \\r\\nprofits in subsidiaries, stipulating that a deferred tax shall be recognized in respect of such accumulated profits, unless it is \\r\\nprobable that they will not be distributed to the parent in the foreseeable future. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has assessed the potential impact of the IFRS Interpretation Committee agenda decision on its financial statements and \\r\\nwill reflect the impact in its 2020 annual financial statements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group presents financial information in interim report in the same format as it was presented in the annual financial \\r\\nstatements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2019, except for several changes in classification within the \\r\\nConsolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as described below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in presentation \\r\\n\\r\\nContent of statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income has been reviewed for the Interm Report. Based on the \\r\\nreview results reclassifications were made for better understanding of the presented financial information. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 30  \\r\\n\\r\\nReclassification was made for following statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income items:  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\n1 January 2019  \\r\\nto 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nQ4 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nAs restated Change \\r\\nAs \\r\\n\\r\\npreviously \\r\\nreported \\r\\n\\r\\nAs \\r\\nrestated \\r\\n\\r\\nChange \\r\\nAs \\r\\n\\r\\npreviously \\r\\nreported \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest income calculated using the effective interest \\r\\nmethod \\r\\n\\r\\n244 765 +1 383 243 382 60 350 +30 60 320 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther similar income 56 912 -1 383 58 295 13 461 -30 13 491 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest and similar expense* -47 525 +9 985 -57 510 -16 403 +2 439 -18 842 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther operating expenses* -9 985 -9 985 0 -2 439 -2 439 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet gain on financial assets and liabilities designated at fair \\r\\nvalue through profit/loss \\r\\n\\r\\n852 -5 315 6 167 372 -4 584 4 956 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet gain on debt securities at fair value through profit or \\r\\nloss \\r\\n\\r\\n5 315 +5 315 0 4 584 +4 584 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther operating expenses** 0 +17 889 -17 889 0 +6 180 -6 180 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther administrative expenses** -165 349 -17 889 -147 460 -51 152 -6 180 -44 972 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther non-operating expenses -2 327 -1 038 -1 289 -722 +68 -790 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (-) / reversal (+) on off-balance sheet \\r\\ncommitments \\r\\n\\r\\n1 038 +1 038 0 -68 -68 0 \\r\\n\\r\\n*Cash contributions to resolution funds and quarantee schemas \\r\\n** Reclassification of other operating expenses to other administrative expenses due to review results which showed that by nature these \\r\\nexpenses were administrative expenses rather than operating expenses (legal expenses and VAT taxes, for example).  \\r\\n \\r\\nReclassification impacted the following condensed consolidated statement of cashflows items:  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n1 January 2019  \\r\\n\\r\\nto 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n As restated Change \\r\\nAs previously \\r\\n\\r\\nreported \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest expenses* 47 525 -9 985 57 510 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest paid -51 790 +9 985 -61 775 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (-) / reversal (+) on off-balance sheet commitments -1 038 -1 038 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther adjustments 2 327 +1 038 1 289 \\r\\n\\r\\n*Cash contributions to resolution funds and quarantee schemas \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and applies assumptions that affect the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements \\r\\nand the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on \\r\\nmanagement’s experience and expectations of future events. \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following financial instruments are subject to the IFRS 9 impairment requirements: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 financial assets measured at amortised cost; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFor financial instruments, which are in scope of impairment requirements, a forward-looking expected credit loss approach is \\r\\napplied and loss allowances for expected credit losses are calculated in the following way: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 31  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for Stage 1 financial instruments where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since the initial recognition \\r\\n(or financial instruments which are considered to have low credit risk) – loss allowances for expected credit losses are \\r\\ncalculated at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for Stage 2 financial instruments where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since the initial recognition (but \\r\\nthey are not classified as credit impaired) - loss allowances for expected credit losses are calculated at an amount equal to \\r\\nlifetime expected credit losses; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for Stage 3 financial instruments which are treated as credit-impaired – loss allowances for expected credit losses are \\r\\ncalculated at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for additional category purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) – loss allowances for expected credit losses \\r\\nare calculated at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses regardless of the changes in credit risk during the \\r\\nlifetime of financial assets. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s expected credit loss (ECL) calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions \\r\\nregarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. The following accounting judgements and estimates of ECL \\r\\nmodels are made when determining impairments of financial assets: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2;  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 identification of unlikeliness to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 classification of forbearance and Watch list; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including \\r\\n\\r\\nthe various formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default \\r\\n\\r\\n(LGD) and exposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\uf0b7 determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic \\r\\n\\r\\nand pessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;  \\r\\n\\uf0b7 estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and assigning \\r\\n\\r\\nprobabilities to those scenarios; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe model applied was not changed during 2020. The macroeconomic parameters were reviewed in the first and second quarters \\r\\nof 2020 to reflect the outlook due to COVID-19. The regular IFRS 9 risk parameter review was performed in the fourth quarter \\r\\nof 2020. The parameters used for the stage 3 collective impairment calculation were updated. The review of macroeconomic \\r\\nparameters and historically observed default frequency levels (applicable for stage 1 and 2 ECL calculations) performed in the \\r\\nfourth quarter indicated that this parameter update would lead to significant reversals of ECLs. Such a reversal of ECLs was not \\r\\nconsidered acceptable taking into account a) the relative lack of effective early indicators to predict credit quality developments \\r\\nin the current crisis, b) the escalation of a second wave of infections and new lockdown measures being applied, c) the moratoria \\r\\neffects (postponed defaults) which are not covered by the model, d) the actual observed default frequency indicator potentially \\r\\nbeing not representative for future default prediction due to recent government measures. Therefore, a management overlay \\r\\nwas applied in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, changes in counting the number of days past due implementing the \\r\\nmateriality thresholds for overdue amounts in line with the regulatory requirements (Regulation (EU) 2018/171) were adopted \\r\\nin the fourth quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nMore qualitative and quantitative information on the impairment of financial assets is provided in the Note 3 General Risk \\r\\nManagement Policies. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived \\r\\nfrom active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. \\r\\nThe input to these models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement \\r\\nis required in establishing fair values. For the fair value of financial assets and liabilities refer to the Note 17. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 32  \\r\\n\\r\\n3. GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required \\r\\nin the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements as \\r\\nat 31 December 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe interim financial statements disclose information on changes directly initiated as part of the Bank’s response to the COVID-\\r\\n19 pandemic and additional information about changes implemented during the reporting period not directly related to COVID-\\r\\n19 pandemic in further sections of this note. \\r\\n\\r\\nMAIN GOALS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of risk management at Luminor is to achieve an optimal balance between the risk of losses and the earnings potential in \\r\\na medium- and long-term perspective.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s Risk Management function as part of the second line of defence consists of the Risk Division and reports to the Chief \\r\\nRisk Officer. The Risk Division is an independent control and reporting function authorized to verify that Luminor’s business and \\r\\nsupporting divisions operate within the set risk appetite and risk strategy. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo further facilitate the leveraging of synergies between departments, the Risk Division is reorganized as of 1 January 2021.  The \\r\\nfirst line of defence tasks previously performed by the Market & Liquidity Risk Department were extracted into the Markets & \\r\\nTreasury Middle Office, which was moved to the Corporate Banking Division. The new organisational chart can be seen below.   \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Enterprise Risk Department is a centralized centre of expertise and manages risk management tools and processes, which \\r\\nrun across different risk types. The Credit Risk Department is responsible for credit risk control. The Operational Risk \\r\\nDepartment is responsible for operational risk control. The Market & Liquidity Risk Department is responsible for market risk \\r\\nand liquidity risk control. The Model Risk & Validation Department is responsible for model risk control and respective validation \\r\\nactivities. The Risk Data & Analytics Department combines most of the activities related to data and modelling.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCREDIT RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nCOVID-19 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe unprecedent COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures imposed by most European countries had an adverse impact \\r\\non the respective economies in the first half of 2020. In particular, the social- and economic constraints imposed by governments \\r\\nacross Europe and also in the Baltic states implied a significant reduction of economic activity in the second quarter of 2020, \\r\\nincluding businesses being almost entirely shut down in certain sectors, and increasing unemployment as a consequence. Since \\r\\nLuminor is one of the largest banks in the Baltic region, many of Luminor’s customers were directly or indirectly affected by this \\r\\nsituation. In the third quarter when the restrictions were gradually lifted, the operating environment improved. However in the \\r\\nfourth quarter of 2020 the epidemiological situation worsened again leading to the reintroduction of some of the earlier lifted \\r\\nrestrictions or introduction of new restrictions. There is still significant uncertainty about the economic impact of this second \\r\\nCOVID-19 wave. \\r\\n\\r\\nA key governmental support measure was the moratoria agreements introduced by the European Banking Authority (the EBA) \\r\\nand regulated by the EBA Guidelines on legislative and non-legislative moratoria on loan repayments applied in the light of the \\r\\nCOVID-19 pandemic (EBA/GL/2020/02). Luminor Bank AS in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania have joined the \\r\\nindustry-wide private moratoria initiatives in each country, which comply with the EBA/GL/2020/02. The moratoria are \\r\\napplicable for performing COVID-19 affected customers that experience temporary financial difficulties but had acceptable \\r\\npayment discipline during the 12 months leading up to the crisis. The terms of postponements are the following:   \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for individual customers, a grace period on principal payments might be granted for up to 12 months for mortgage loans \\r\\nand for up to 6 months for consumer credits and leasing agreements; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 for business customers with an exposure below 5 million EUR, the period of payment postponement is up to 6 months for \\r\\namortising products. \\r\\n\\r\\nGroup Chief Risk Officer\\r\\n\\r\\nEnterprise Risk Credit Risk Operational Risk Market & \\r\\nLiquidity Risk\\r\\n\\r\\nModel Risk & \\r\\nInternal \\r\\n\\r\\nValidation\\r\\n\\r\\nRisk Data & \\r\\nAnalytics\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 33  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nNo other conditions shall be changed. The modifications under the moratoria are not classified as forbearance. For the cases not \\r\\nmeeting moratoria conditions, individual solutions are applied and individual assessments on the exposure classification are \\r\\nperformed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe moratoria initially were meant to be in force until 30 June 2020, then were prolonged until 30 September 2020. On 2 \\r\\nDecember 2020 the EBA announced the reactivation of EBA/GL/2020/02. Industry-wide moratoria were relaunched on 18 \\r\\nJanuary 2021 in Lithuania, moratoria in Estonia and Latvia have not been prolonged. According to the relaunched moratoria the \\r\\ncumulative grace period cannot exceed 9 months for individual customers’ mortgage loans and 6 months for individual \\r\\ncustomers’ consumer credits and leasing agreements and business customers’ loans. \\r\\n\\r\\nGrace periods of COVID-19 affected, and modified exposures have already ended during 2020 for the majority (90%) of them. \\r\\nThe grace periods for the remaining 10% of exposure will end in 2021.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has been monitoring the spread of COVID-19 since early 2020 and has adjusted its risk management to the new \\r\\noperating environment. Customers where deterioration of the credit quality was observed or predicted based on the changed \\r\\noperating environment were included into the Watch list in order to monitor them more thoroughly. A Weekly Early Warning \\r\\nIndicator tracker has been established to enable close monitoring of the changes in the portfolio. Luminor furthermore follows-\\r\\nup on the performance of customers after the end of grace periods, relative to the performance of customers without \\r\\nmodifications. Luminor will continue to adjust its credit risk management as and if needed, based on internal portfolio’s trends \\r\\nand overall market situation. \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment policies \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor recognises credit losses in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9, which applies a forward-looking ECL approach. \\r\\nFor more detailed information on the impairment policies, please refer to the Note 5 General Risk Management Policies of the \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Annual Report 2019. During 2020 the impairment model remained unchanged. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn line with regulatory requirements (Regulation (EU) 2018/171), the methodological change introducing materiality thresholds \\r\\nin regard to more than 90 days past due default indicator was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor identifies default when either or both of the following default indicators materialize: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The customer is past due more than 90 days on any material overdue amount to Luminor; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 The customer is considered unlikely to pay its credit obligations to Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nCounting of days past due on a customer level starts when the overdue amount on a customer level breaches the materiality \\r\\nthresholds: \\r\\n\\uf0b7 for individual customers – more than 100 EUR and more than 1% of its credit obligations to Luminor; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 for business customers – more than 500 EUR and more than 1% of its credit obligations to Luminor. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe same principles for counting days past due taking into account materiality thresholds are applied in regard to more than 30 \\r\\ndays past due on a financial instrument significant increase in credit risk (SICR) indicator. \\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, Luminor treats a financial asset as facing SICR, if at least one of the following SICR indicators is identified after initial \\r\\nrecognition of the financial instrument and was not present as of its origination: \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Significant increase of lifetime PD – significant increase of lifetime PD since initial recognition until the reporting date (2.5 \\r\\n\\r\\ntimes and 0.6 p.p. jointly), \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Risk grade 9 or 10 – risk grade 9 or 10 as at the reporting date, \\r\\n\\uf0b7 >30 days past due – more than 30 days past due (applying materiality threshold) as at the reporting date, \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Forborne performing – forborne performing status as at the reporting date (forbearance not triggering non-performing \\r\\n\\r\\nstatus), \\r\\n\\uf0b7 Watch list – watch list status as at the reporting date. \\r\\n\\r\\nCounting of days past due on the financial instrument level starts when the overdue amount on the financial asset breaches the \\r\\nabsolute and relative materiality thresholds which are the same as on customer level (100 EUR and 1% for individual customers \\r\\nor 500 EUR and 1% for business customers). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe modifications granted for COVID-19 affected customers do not automatically indicate SICR, nor a classification to forbearance \\r\\nor default status. However, Luminor’s obligation to assess for unlikeliness to pay (which consequently triggers default status) \\r\\nremains in place.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGross amount and expected credit loss allowance amount for loans and leases as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 \\r\\nare disclosed in the tables below: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 34  \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2020  \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR  \\r\\nNote Gross \\r\\n\\r\\nAllowance for \\r\\nexpected credit \\r\\n\\r\\nlosses \\r\\nNet \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from banks and other credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n9 70 595 -16 70 579 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial institutions 11 132 524 -482 132 042 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic sector  11 138 599 -14 138 585 \\r\\n\\r\\n   Business customers  11 3 846 885 -78 119 3 768 766 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans   2 823 103 -61 735 2 761 368 \\r\\n\\r\\nFactoring   180 884 -2 136 178 748 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing  842 898 -14 248 828 650 \\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual customers 11 5 449 706 -58 264 5 391 442 \\r\\n\\r\\nMortgage loans  4 614 261 -44 192 4 570 069 \\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer and card loans  106 307 -1 045 105 262 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther loans  274 866 -8 935 265 931 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing  454 272 -4 092 450 180 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  9 638 309 -136 895 9 501 414 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\nNote Gross \\r\\n\\r\\nAllowance for \\r\\nexpected credit \\r\\n\\r\\nlosses \\r\\nNet \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from banks and other credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n9 141 654 -9 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial institutions 11 29 378 -123 29 255 \\r\\n\\r\\nPublic sector 11 174 732 -17 174 715 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Business customers  11 4 523 201 -111 037 4 412 164 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans   3 156 365 -95 544 3 060 821 \\r\\n\\r\\nFactoring   278 511 -1 691 276 820 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing  1 088 325 -13 802 1 074 523 \\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual customers 11 5 680 911 -74 498 5 606 413 \\r\\n\\r\\nMortgage loans  4 689 319 -56 080 4 633 239 \\r\\n\\r\\nConsumer and card loans  132 862 -1 452 131 410 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther loans  325 119 -11 938 313 181 \\r\\n\\r\\nLeasing  533 611 -5 028 528 583 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  10 549 876 -185 684 10 364 192 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe credit quality of loans to customers as at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 are disclosed in the tables below \\r\\naccording to the internal risk scale for performing customers: the probability of default for low risk rating grades (1 to 4) is in \\r\\nthe range from 0.00% to 0.75%, for moderate risk rating grades (5 to 7) the probability ranges from 0.75% to 3.00%, for high \\r\\nrisk rating grades (from 8 to 10) it ranges from 3.00% to 40.00%.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe portfolio distribution as at 31 December 2020 shows an increase in Stage 2 (mostly due to inclusion of customers in Watch-\\r\\nlist, forbearance measures applied and downgrades) and decrease in Stage 3 (outflow outweighs the inflow of new non-\\r\\nperforming exposures) compared to the end of year 2019.

Each manager and process owner within the bank is responsible for the management of risks inherent in the \\r\\nactivities and processes within their respective area. This includes fostering a sound risk culture in their respective reporting \\r\\nlines to ensure that employees understand the operations that are performed by them, the risks inherent in these, and the \\r\\nimportance of controls they execute or oversee the execution of.   \\r\\n\\r\\nA key objective of the Operational Risk Department is to identify any deviations of Luminor’s operational risk profile from the \\r\\ndesired risk level that is stated in the Risk Appetite Framework, and to do so in a timely manner to ensure any deviations can be \\r\\neffectively managed without significant detriment to the bank, its customers or other stakeholders. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Luminor operates a system of predefined controls in the form of COVID-19 response \\r\\nstates.  These response states allow management to quickly and effectively increase or decrease COVID-19 related restrictions \\r\\nand limitations in response to perceived threat and risk levels.  The COVID-19 response states are designed as a baseline to \\r\\nmanage the risk to Luminor and the bank’s stakeholders and are country-based.  Should there be a variation between the \\r\\nrestrictions in the relevant COVID-19 response state and local governmental rules or advice, the more conservative of the two \\r\\nwill prevail. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor management is kept updated on the status of operational risk through periodic and ad hoc risk reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nMARKET RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has a low risk appetite for market risk, which is defined as the risk of losses from on- and off-balance sheet positions \\r\\narising from adverse movements in market parameters such as interest rates, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, equity \\r\\nprices or commodity prices. Based on Luminor’s internal risk self-assessment, the most significant parts of the market risk for \\r\\nthe Group are interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange risk, which all stayed well within internal Risk Appetite \\r\\nFramework and lower level limits, while the exposures were at similar levels as they were during the last reporting quarter. The \\r\\nsignificance of other risks is lower, as the Group does not have any open positions in equity instruments for trading, and all \\r\\ncommodity deals with customers are hedged with back-to-back transactions. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the major negative impact to the Group in terms of market risk could arise \\r\\nfrom credit spread risk. This risk is mitigated by limits as well as certain quality requirements for the liquidity bond portfolio. \\r\\nThe Bank follows a rigorous framework for debt securities management. Bond portfolios managed by the Treasury & Asset and \\r\\nLiability Management Department and Markets Department are restricted in terms of size, level of quality, region and \\r\\ncounterparty, limiting credit risk exposure. \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY RISK \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations in time, the risk of incurring losses \\r\\ndue to a sudden decrease in financial resources (e.g. a financial crisis situation may result in a delay of incoming payments) or an \\r\\nincrease of the price of new resources for refinancing. The consequence of liquidity risk may be failure to meet obligations to \\r\\nrepay depositors and fulfil loan commitments.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed to ensure a constant ability to settle contractual obligations. The Group has developed a set of early \\r\\nwarning indicators and limits for a timely identification of liquidity crises, and business and funding contingency plans to manage \\r\\nthe Group’s liquidity during market disruptions. The liquidity risk management strategy is reviewed at least annually or after any \\r\\nsignificant change in the internal or external environment the Group operates in.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLiquidity risk is managed across the three lines of defence: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The first line of defence comprises the Group’s Treasury & Asset and Liability Management (TALM) department and the \\r\\nbusiness areas. TALM is responsible for the daily liquidity management and funds transfer pricing (FTP). To ensure the \\r\\nfunding in situations where Luminor is in urgent need of cash and the normal funding sources do not suffice, Luminor \\r\\nholds a liquidity buffer that consists of Central Bank cash and high quality securities that can be readily sold or used as \\r\\ncollateral for funding operations;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The Market and Liquidity Risk department is the second line of defence and is responsible for providing independent \\r\\noversight and control of liquidity risk and the first line of defence; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The Internal Audit function is the third line of defence, which is responsible for providing independent assurance over the \\r\\nfirst and second lines of defence activities. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nLiquidity risk management has a focus on short term obligations and more structural long-term liquidity risk applying different \\r\\ninternal and external metrics. The Group uses a range of liquidity metrics for measuring, monitoring and controlling liquidity risk \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 41  \\r\\n\\r\\nincluding the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), internal liquidity limits and trigger events, \\r\\nand the survival horizon metric as a part of liquidity stress testing. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of intraday and short-term liquidity management is to meet the daily need for funds to ensure compliance with the \\r\\nreserve and liquidity requirements set by the ECB, as well as compliance with internal liquidity limits. Short-term liquidity is \\r\\nmaintained through the daily monitoring of the liquidity status, day-to-day funding and trading the appropriate financial \\r\\ninstruments for liquidity purposes. Long-term liquidity risk management is supported by analysing the estimated future cash \\r\\nflows considering deposit and loan portfolio growth, as well as possible refinancing sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the purpose of liquidity risk assessment, the liquidity gap is analysed considering the maturity of cash flows. The liquidity \\r\\nrisk is restricted by imposing internal limits on the liquidity gap. Utilisation of this limit is subject to regular monitoring and \\r\\nreporting to management bodies in the Group. The liquidity gap is calculated by analysing the Group’s net refinancing situation \\r\\nwithin one week, one month and three months applying a \"business as usual\" approach. Liquid assets and short-term liabilities \\r\\nare included in liquidity gap calculations for respective terms (1 week to 3 months). \\r\\n\\r\\nThe LCR is calculated as the ratio of a credit institution’s liquidity buffer to its net liquidity outflows over a 30-calendar-day stress \\r\\nperiod and is expressed as a percentage. The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of the Group’s liquidity risk \\r\\nprofile and requires the holding of risk-free assets that may be easily liquidated to meet required payments for outflows net of \\r\\ninflows during a thirty-day crisis period without support from the central bank. The minimum regulatory limit of LCR is set at \\r\\n100%, however the Group has a substantial buffer over it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe NSFR is defined as the amount of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding over a one-year \\r\\ntime horizon. The minimum requirement for NSFR is 100%, however the Group has a substantial buffer and maintains a higher \\r\\nratio. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has set the limits in place for various measures, including LCR, NSFR, liquidity gaps, and manages those within the set \\r\\nlimits by ensuring the proper maturity structure of its assets and liabilities, for example, via issuing long dated debt.

Accounts where the Group held 4.8 billion EUR at the end of December \\r\\n2020. This buffer can be utilized at any time when the need arises. On top of the Central Bank Accounts, the buffer also includes \\r\\nthe liquidity bond portfolio (excluding Markets’ assets as per the internal definition of the liquidity buffer) of 275 million EUR \\r\\nconsisting mainly of debt securities issued by Baltic governments.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity buffer is supported by the contractual agreement for funding with shareholders DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank \\r\\nAbp. Together with the capability to issue covered bonds, these strongly mitigate the likelihood of funding liquidity risk, which \\r\\nmay be caused by deposit run-off, wholesale funding risk (roll-over and new issuance), unexpected outflows from off-balance \\r\\nsheet obligations and legal risks (e.g. not being able to issue funding due to legal restrictions). This agreement introduces the \\r\\nrequirement for collateral as the facility is collateralized with assets, primarily with mortgages.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group is taking part in the ECB’s Eurosystem open market operations. In particular, the Group is a user of the ECB Targeted \\r\\nLong Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) which also requires collateral. Another source of encumbrance arises from issued \\r\\nCovered Bonds.  Encumbrance arising from pledged assets is reported and monitored. The collateral is managed by monitoring \\r\\nthe fulfilment of the requirements for each type of collateral. \\r\\n\\r\\nSurvival horizon \\r\\n\\r\\nThe key metric for liquidity risk appetite set in the Risk Appetite Framework is the survival horizon analysed across different \\r\\nstress scenarios. The survival horizon is defined as a period with a positive cumulative cash flow. It is used to capture the liquidity \\r\\nbuffer available outright to be used in liquidity stress situations within 12 months. The outcome of liquidity stress testing is the \\r\\nnumber of days the Group can withstand a liquidity crisis considering Luminor’s mitigating capacity, for example the liquidity \\r\\nbuffer. \\r\\n\\r\\nThree different scenarios are considered while measuring the survival horizon: bank-specific, market-wide and the combination \\r\\nof the most severe assumptions from the previous two. Stress testing assumptions include but are not limited to severe deposit \\r\\nwithdrawals, including early termination of term deposits and run-off of top 5 depositors, deterioration of financial assets, \\r\\ndecrease of loan repayment levels, increase of utilization of credit commitments, as well as limited availability of credit lines from \\r\\nshareholders based on the existing Facility Agreement. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 46  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquidity buffer for the survival horizon metric is strongly affected by the assumption of outgoing deposits in the first few \\r\\ndays and weeks of the turbulence period, with the smaller continuous run-off occurring in the following months. Due to rather \\r\\nhigh concentration of top depositors, the Group tests resistance towards a run-off of the 5 largest depositors as well. Total funds \\r\\nof the top 5 largest depositors amounted to 2 008 million EUR at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 1 347 million \\r\\nEUR at the end of 2019. Despite that the Group has sufficient liquidity and can survive for longer than a 1-year period without \\r\\nany additional support.  Furthermore, the majority of the liquidity buffer consists of cash held within central banks and highly \\r\\nliquid debt securities which serves to mitigate the consequences of deteriorating liquidity in case of high outflows.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group’s liquidity situation is sufficiently strong to survive severe external \\r\\nshocks. \\r\\n\\r\\nCAPITAL MANAGEMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s regulatory capital consists solely of Tier 1/Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Tier1/CET1 capital consists of \\r\\nordinary shares, share premium, mandatory reserve, retained earnings of the previous financial year, the audited profit of the \\r\\ncurrent financial year and less the intangible assets, deferred tax assets, revaluation profit of investment properties, current year \\r\\nlosses, if any, and other deductions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe capital is calculated and allocated for risk coverage following the regulations in the CRD IV and CRR of the EU and the \\r\\napplicable regulatory requirements. The Group’s objectives in capital management are as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 consistency with Luminor Group’s long-term strategy (including meeting the risk appetite of the Group) and the Dividend \\r\\npolicy; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 the ability to pursue the business objectives; \\r\\n\\uf0b7 fulfilment of both internal and external capitalisation targets (capital adequacy); \\r\\n\\uf0b7 sufficient and proper composition of capital that would withstand stressful events. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe capital adequacy assessment is performed on a quarterly basis in accordance with the information guidelines for the risk \\r\\nmanagement and capital adequacy disclosure (Pillar 3) report. \\r\\n\\r\\nQuantitative information regarding the capital managed by the Group is presented below: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nAccording to the prudential requirements, the Pillar 2 requirement set by the ECB in the 2019 Joint Decision on Capital and the \\r\\nSystemic risk and Countercyclical risk buffer requirements set by the Central Banks of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, Luminor \\r\\n\\r\\n thousand EUR 31 December 2020 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nOWN FUNDS     \\r\\n\\r\\n1.

The Group does not apply any Value at Risk (VaR) or other internal models for the calculation \\r\\nof the market risk capital requirement and applies the Basic Indicators Approach for calculating the operational risk capital \\r\\nrequirements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk-weighted assets are measured by means of risk weights classified according to the nature of each asset and counterparty, \\r\\ntaking into account the collaterals and guarantees eligible for risk mitigation. A similar treatment with some adjustments is \\r\\nadopted for the off-balance sheet exposures. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group reviews and improves the risk identification and management policies and procedures according to changes in the \\r\\nGroup’s activities and financial situation at least once a year. Amendments and updates are mostly done during the annual \\r\\ninternal capital adequacy assessment process when significant risks are to be reassessed or identified and assessed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group complied with all externally imposed capital requirements during the reporting period. \\r\\n\\r\\nGOING CONCERN \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor’s management is fully convinced of a stable and balanced performance going forward and based on that, prepared \\r\\nthese financial statements on a going concern basis. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 48  \\r\\n\\r\\n4.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where \\r\\nthe fair values of financial assets and liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active \\r\\nmarkets, they are determined in a way that unobservable inputs used to measure fair value would reflect the assumptions that \\r\\nmarket participants would use when pricing assets and liabilities, including assumptions about the risk. Where observable \\r\\nmarket data is not available, expert judgment is required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements, \\r\\nthe above-mentioned techniques related to unobservable inputs were not used as no such financial assets and liabilities exist on \\r\\nthe statement of financial position of the Group.  \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 56  \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTISED COSTS \\r\\n\\r\\nthousand EUR  \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2020 31 December 2020 31 December 2019 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortised cost         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 4 926 520 4 926 520 2 924 019 2 924 019 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 70 579 70 579 141 645 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 9 430 835 9 107 048 10 222 547 10 324 772 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 14 427 934 14 104 147 13 288 211 13 390 436 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortised cost     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n\\r\\n85 241 85 241 980 692 980 692 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 11 783 762 11 783 762 10 235 443 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 1 201 232 1 200 230 651 716 653 967 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 14 705 14 705 45 303 45 303 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 13 084 940 13 083 938 11 913 154 11 915 405 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarises the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities. Financial \\r\\ninstruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value:  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the \\r\\nmeasurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and shall be used \\r\\nwithout adjustment to measure fair value whenever available; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Level 2 — valuation techniques for which inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 are observable for the \\r\\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must \\r\\nbe observable for a substantial part of the term of the asset or liability; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Level 3 — valuation techniques for which inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be \\r\\nused to measure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations \\r\\nin which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value \\r\\nmeasurement objective remains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market \\r\\nparticipant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs shall reflect the assumptions that \\r\\nmarket participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 57  \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 31 December 2020 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using \\r\\n \\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 4 926 520 0 0 4 926 520 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 70 556 23 0 70 579 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 9 107 048 9 107 048 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial assets 0 0 10 226 10 226 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading     \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 2 857 0 0 2 857 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss     \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 2 682 0 2 682 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities     \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral governments 251 143 0 0 251 143 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 24 085 0 0 24 085 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial corporations 0 0 6 239 6 239 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments     \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 42 739 668 43 407 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive \\r\\nincome \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 140 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  5 275 161 45 444 9 124 321 14 444 926 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are disclosed     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 55 267 29 974 0 85 241 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 10 696 739 1 087 023 11 783 762 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 499 265 700 965 0 1 200 230 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 14 705 14 705 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value     \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments     \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 49 236 1 347 50 583 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  554 532 11 476 914 1 103 075 13 134 521 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 58  \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 31 December 2019 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using \\r\\n \\r\\nthousand EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in \\r\\nactive markets \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nobservable inputs \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\nunobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets         \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed         \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and balances with central banks 2 924 019 0 0 2 924 019 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 141 596 49 0 141 645 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 10 324 772 10 324 772 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial assets 0  0 29 113 29 113 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value         \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading         \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 3 021 0 0 3 021 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss         \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 4 033 0 4 033 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities         \\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral governments 195 989 0 0 195 989 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit Institutions 15 023 0 0 15 023 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial corporations 0 0 12 851 12 851 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments         \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 58 087 1 130 59 217 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive \\r\\nincome \\r\\n\\r\\n        \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 140 140 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  3 279 648 62 169 10 368 006 13 709 823 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities         \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are disclosed         \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 29 080 951 612 0 980 692 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 8 074 410 2 161 033 10 235 443 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 653 967 0 653 967 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 45 303 45 303 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value         \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments         \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 56 042 2 262 58 304 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  29 080 9 736 031 2 208 598 11 973 709 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Non-trading financial assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss (Pension Funds) -

Pension fund units are revalued according to the effective net \\r\\nasset value on the balance sheet date;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Cash and cash balances with central banks – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at \\r\\nthe same price in an orderly transaction;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Due from other credit institutions – the fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at the same \\r\\nprice in an orderly transaction. Due from other credit institutions are demand deposits;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Loans to customers – fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows with the loan portfolio \\r\\naverage rate which was calculated based on the Bank new sales margin of the fourth quarter of 2020 and total volume of \\r\\nthe loan portfolio that included credit risk factors. Same valuation technique is applied to all loan classes and accordingly \\r\\nall loan classes are classified under fair value level 3. As at 31 December 2019 fair value was estimated by discounting \\r\\nestimated future cash flows with the base curve used by the Bank (6m Euribor curve as average for all loans) as adjusted \\r\\nby credit risk factors; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (debt securities) - for domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic \\r\\nstates, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish \\r\\nthe trading offers in the form of prices, yields or equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the \\r\\naverage of bid prices shall be used taking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic \\r\\nstates, or there are no quotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers \\r\\nare clearly incorrect or artificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data using \\r\\nsources like Bloomberg or similar; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the interest \\r\\nrates for items with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured using the assumptions \\r\\nthat market participants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best \\r\\ninterest;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (equities, debt securities):  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 The quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source for local equities. These are securities \\r\\nfor which active market exists based on the turnover, meaning availability of quotes at which market \\r\\nparticipants transact in the local stock market. The quotes of foreign equities shall be taken from Bloomberg \\r\\ngiving the priority to the primary market, and then to the country of issuer if the active market exists there. \\r\\nOtherwise, the market with the highest liquidity (turnover) shall be used as a source for pricing. If the quotes \\r\\nin primary data sources are clearly incorrect or artificial, the price of particular equity shall be derived from \\r\\nliquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or similar. Correctness of the quotes described above are the \\r\\nsubject of expert judgment of the Market & Liquidity Risk Department member together with the Bank’s \\r\\nMarkets Department’s dealer responsible for equity trading. For equities of non-listed companies for which \\r\\nactive market does not exist, any available trusted public information on recent trades shall be used for the \\r\\npricing of the equity. Alternatively, dividend discount model shall be used to determine the price of equity. \\r\\nExpert opinion based on other available related market data shall be used for pricing of equity if the previously \\r\\ndescribed methods are not possible;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 For domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be \\r\\nthe priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading offers in the form of prices, yields \\r\\nor equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid prices shall be used \\r\\ntaking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no \\r\\nquotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are \\r\\nclearly incorrect or artificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data \\r\\nusing sources like Bloomberg or similar;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Derivative financial instruments – market data from financial data vendors, electronic trading platforms or third-party \\r\\nvaluation are used for valuation purposes. The derivatives represent non-complex products valued with generally \\r\\naccepted models. Valuation inputs are derived from the market data;  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 Loans and deposits from credit institutions – the fair value of loans equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the loans from \\r\\ncredit institutions is under market conditions. Expected cash flows of the liabilities from the banks are discounted with \\r\\nthe same market rates as loans. Loans from credit institutions are long-term. Deposits from credit institutions are demand \\r\\ndeposits. The fair value of deposits equals to their carrying value.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by the IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as the Management Board. The \\r\\nManagement Board monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about \\r\\nresource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit before tax and is measured \\r\\nconsistently with profit before tax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of expenses after \\r\\ninternal funds transfer pricing, as management primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a \\r\\nperformance measure. Fees and commission income for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made \\r\\nbetween different product categories for segment reporting.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for two main operating segments: Corporate Banking and Retail Banking. Operating segments are \\r\\nreported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. Corporate Banking segment services business \\r\\ncustomers that have a dedicated relationship manager and all leasing customers who do not have a bank relationship. Retail \\r\\nBanking segment services business customers without a dedicated relationship manager, private individuals and holding \\r\\ncompanies associated with wealthy private individuals. Results of other operating segments are included in Other segment.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2020 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 62  \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments \\r\\n(including internal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Other segment) and income and expenses not \\r\\nbooked on customer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using internally agreed allocation mechanisms. \\r\\nOnly assets and liabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating segments are reported under the respective \\r\\nsegments, all other balance sheet items are not reported under the operating segments to CODM. Loans and Deposits are reported \\r\\nunder operating segments at Gross amounts (and excluding accrued interest). Net impairment (losses/reversal) on loans to \\r\\ncustomers is monitored for each of the segments at Profit or Loss side, while at the Assets side, the CODM only monitors Gross \\r\\namounts of Loans to customers, with impairment allowances not being allocated to operating segments.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first quarter of 2020 it was decided to transfer customers with leasing exposures but without a relationship to bank \\r\\nentities from Other segment to Corporate segment and restatement was made also to historic periods. From the fourth quarter \\r\\nof 2020 it was decided to transfer Wealth Management segment customers under Retail Banking segment and restatement was \\r\\nmade also to historic periods.  From the first quarter of 2020 Luminor started applying Activity Based Costing to allocate \\r\\npersonnel costs, administrative costs and depreciation between operating segments and restatement was also made to segment \\r\\nsplit of costs to 2019 figures. The asymmetrical allocation of allowance for impairment Net impairment (losses/reversal) on loans \\r\\nto customers, as described above, was applied from the second quarter of 2020.

Luminor is an Estonian registered credit \\r\\ninstitution, with sizable branches in Lithuania and Latvia. From here on we will focus on creating a pan-Baltic, modern, and flexible \\r\\norganization to be a valuable business partner to our customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nHaving been born from the merger of the Baltic operations of two Northern Europe’s largest financial institutions we will use this \\r\\nglobal knowhow to become the best financial partner in the Baltics for the local way of life and doing business, who is independent \\r\\nand free to proceed in our decisions from local interests. We will do this by being entrepreneurial, collaborative and open, and offering \\r\\nthe best in customer experience, value management and solutions to meet the needs of our present and future customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe economic environment of the Baltic countries has continued to be favorable for our plans. We have taken advantage of healthy \\r\\ngrowth rates in GDP, almost full employment, balanced current accounts, a as well as healthy levels of saving rates and close to \\r\\nbalanced budgets. We see the economic backdrop remaining positive and supportive in the coming quarters as well.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first quarter of this year has been full of various activities. A lot of emphasis has been put on efficiency, as we have continued the \\r\\nprocesses of adjusting our operating model and building the foundation for future Luminor. We have harmonized overhead and group \\r\\nfunctions and removed duplicated activities. Our staff reductions are also progressing as planned. We continue to move ahead with \\r\\nour ongoing initiatives to simplify our products and services portfolio, to make the bank more accessible to all customers. We are \\r\\nlaunching a major initiative to upgrade online services across our three home markets, towards both households and corporates. Very \\r\\nintense work is going on in the field of system consolidation and migration. Our focus is on carving out and improving Luminor's IT \\r\\nenvironment and in that way further improve our efficiency.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are continuously improving our funding position and growing our deposit base. Our deposits across all segments have grown by \\r\\nmore than EUR 1 billion compared to the same period in 2018, and the loans to deposits ratio has improved to 120.1% by the end of \\r\\nthis quarter. This is a great development in terms of supporting Luminor's funding independence and efficient balance sheet \\r\\nmanagement.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFighting financial crime will remain one of our key priorities, as it has been since the creation of Luminor. Our proficiency in monitoring \\r\\nand detecting cases of attempted or suspicious money laundering is continuously improving. \\r\\n\\r\\nA consortium led by funds managed by Blackstone signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake of Luminor in September 2018. \\r\\nWhile the transaction remains subject to regulatory approval of the European Central Bank and local regulators, then based on the \\r\\ncurrent state of the approval process, the parties expect to close the transaction no later than during second half of 2019. Luminor´s \\r\\ntransformation is one of the biggest and most interesting of its kind in the Baltics. We are directing all our investments and efforts \\r\\ntowards our vision to create a modern, accessible and truly Baltic  financial partner we think our customers deserve. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n   \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 4  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nOverview \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor (Luminor Bank AS) was established on 1 October 2017 as a result of the merger of DNB Bank ASA (Commercial Register no. \\r\\n984 851 006) and Nordea Bank AB (Swedish Commercial Register no. 516406-0120) operations in the Baltic countries to create a new-\\r\\ngeneration financial service provider for local businesses and financially active people.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest financial services provider in the Baltics, with approximately 1 million clients, 2760 employees, 17% market \\r\\nshare in deposits and 21% market share in lending as at the end of first quarter 2019. Total shareholders’ equity amounts to EUR 1.8 \\r\\nbillion and Luminor is capitalized with a CET1 ratio of 20%. Luminor’s vision is to become the best financial ecosystem for its customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, an agreement was signed between DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank AB with US-based private equity firm \\r\\nBlackstone to sell the majority stake in Luminor. As part of the transaction, Blackstone will acquire a 60% majority stake in the bank. \\r\\nNordea and DNB will retain equal 20% equity stakes in Luminor and will continue to support the bank with long term funding, \\r\\nexpertise, and ongoing representation on the Supervisory Council.

The average annual growth rate for 2017-18 has exceeded 4% in Estonia and Latvia, with \\r\\na robust 3.8% boost in Lithuania. This compares to a close to two percent average GDP advance in the Euro area.  \\r\\n\\r\\nA shift from de-synchronized growth to synchronized moderation of global growth may well be the core economic theme for 2019, \\r\\nwith risks emanating from softer global trade and waning momentum across developed and emerging countries. This can also taper \\r\\nexport revenues in the open Baltic economies. Euro area annual GDP growth decelerated from 1.6% in third quarter of 2018 to only \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 5  \\r\\n\\r\\n1.1% in last quarter, with softer contribution from industrial and trade sectors. Incoming data continues to be weak, especially for the \\r\\nmanufacturing sector, mainly on account of the slowdown in external demand, which has been compounded by some country- and \\r\\nsector-specific factors. As the impact of these factors is turning out to be somewhat longer-lasting, the slower growth momentum is \\r\\nexpected to extend into the current year. Looking ahead, the effect of these adverse factors is expected to unwind. \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the weaker backdrop in external markets the Baltic countries sustained a strong broad-based economic momentum in second \\r\\nhalf of 2018 with growth picking up towards the year end, increasing to 4.1%, 5.4%, and 3.3% annual pace respectively in Estonia, \\r\\nLatvia and Lithuania. While the domestic demand has remained the key growth engine, exports have also expanded at a healthy rate \\r\\nespecially in Estonia and Lithuania. Latvia continues to exceed expectations with strong performance in consumption and \\r\\ninvestments, with the help of EU structural funds and industry appetite for investments. Structural changes proceed at a healthy pace \\r\\nwith the share of more dynamic high value-added services (ICT, business services), and manufacturing (machinery, chemicals) \\r\\nexpanding. The Baltic countries expansion will continue to be supported by rising wages, moderating inflationary pressures and \\r\\nfurther employment gains, and the ongoing – albeit somewhat slower – expansion in Euro area and Nordic countries.    \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nActivities \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries through the Estonian \\r\\nhead-quartered bank and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger all assets, rights and liabilities of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank continues the \\r\\nactivities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches. A new organizational set up, a new governance structure, \\r\\nand new members of management bodies were also introduced. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe deposits and financial instruments of the depositors and customers using investment services of Luminor Bank AS Latvian branch \\r\\nand Luminor Bank AS Lithuanian branch are guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and investor protection scheme established and \\r\\noperated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 January 2019 Luminor proceeded with the next phase of transformation. The bank aims to transform its operating model by \\r\\nsimplifying its structure and decision process, unifying and executing IT consolidation, strengthening its controls, and becoming more \\r\\nefficient, more resilient and more resolvable. Due to this Luminor team was reduced by 266 employees during first quarter of 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn first quarter the start of customer data and services transfer to unified Luminor system was announced in Latvia and Lithuania. \\r\\nDigital team continued their efforts on developing new Luminor digital channels and preparing our current channels for customer \\r\\ndata transfer process. The main task of this process is to offer similar functional possibilities to customers transferred and secure \\r\\nsmooth and uninterrupted services to our customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe code cards still used in Latvia and Lithuania as customer authorization tool will be discontinued in the second part of the year. \\r\\nThe customers are encouraged to discover other modern digital authorization tools and offered help in starting using them.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOpen Banking developer portal was launched in the first quarter. We are also progressing with setting up more automated process \\r\\nin consumer and mortgage loans area. \\r\\n\\r\\nRETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking management model has been adjusted to support delivering excellence in customer experience and meeting our \\r\\ncustomers’ needs. In January Luminor announced the transformation of its customer service centers network as part of the bank´s \\r\\nstrategic initiative to be carried out during 2019. The plan consists of consolidating certain customer service centers into nearby \\r\\nlocations, revisiting customer service model, strengthening the bank´s digital service offer, and introducing customers to cashless \\r\\nplatforms and payment systems.   \\r\\n\\r\\nRetail banking team has consolidated its marketing and sales campaigns across the Baltics and initiated the first pan-Baltic sales \\r\\ncampaign with aligned offer. The campaign has resulted in the growth of retail customer deposits by 14.1% in the first quarter \\r\\ncompared to the same period in 2018. The lending volumes for retail customers remained stable during the quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nA lending centralization project has also been implemented and has resulted in knowledge centralization and increased effectiveness \\r\\nin decision making.  At the end of first quarter this year, Luminor serviced its customers in total 50 customer service centers across \\r\\nthe Baltics.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 6  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn first quarter of 2019 servicing of the Corporate Banking customers was consolidated into a pan-Baltic Corporate Banking division. \\r\\nAs a part of this change, our smaller corporate customers will be served in the Retail Banking division going forward. This change \\r\\nallows Corporate Banking to increase efficiency and improve service quality for our largest corporate customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the quarter, the deposit volumes in the Corporate Banking segment continued to increase with growth rates reaching 17% \\r\\ncompared to the same period in 2018. Loan portfolio contracted somewhat due to our focus on improving profitability of our assets. \\r\\nRisk-related costs were slightly positive, as loan write-backs still outweigh new provisions, as a result of positive macro-economic \\r\\nenvironment. \\r\\n\\r\\nWEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nWealth Management Segment has been introduced in the first quarter 2019 by merging our Private Banking, Asset Management, and \\r\\nPensions segments.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWealth Management is focusing on continued consolidation of pan-Baltic operations by transforming from a country based \\r\\norganizational set up to a pan-Baltic set up and development of the team. Cooperation with other business segments, customer \\r\\nsatisfaction, participation in pension reforms in Lithuania and Latvia, and developing new sales channels in Estonia were among the \\r\\nmain priorities during the quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first quarter 2019 pension assets under management in Baltics reached EUR 1.28 billion, up 12% compared to same period in \\r\\n2018. Luminor had 309 thousand second pillar and 64 thousand third pillar pension customers at the end of the quarter. Luminor's \\r\\nlong-term performance of pension funds is among the best in the market in both second and third pillar funds.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking focuses on growing assets under management and keeping a high level of customer satisfaction, by helping affluent \\r\\nand high net worth individuals and their families to grow, manage, and preserve their wealth. During the quarter Private Banking \\r\\nfocused on attracting new customers with several macro- and investments-related seminars. The team has continued the \\r\\ncollaboration with Luminor’s other business segments to help deliver results. Efforts were also put towards new products, helping to \\r\\nimplement competitive daily banking offering. During the first quarter 2019 assets under management grew 9% compared to the \\r\\nsame period in 2018. Luminor has around 3,300 Private Banking customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN LUMINOR  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is creating a new-generation financial services provider because it is determined to build a better tomorrow – for families \\r\\nand businesses and for the communities and countries in which we live and operate.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is committed to taking into account corporate governance, social conditions and environment in all the activities, including \\r\\nproduct and service development, advisory services and sales, investment and credit decisions, and other operations. Luminor does \\r\\nnot contribute to the infringement of human or labor rights, corruption, environmental harm or other actions that could be regarded \\r\\nas unethical. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has a responsibility to make an effort to ensure that the banking industry delivers ethical products and services. We take \\r\\nresponsibility for whom our products and services are offered to, as well as how. \\r\\n\\r\\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING RELATED MATTERS  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has chosen to serve primarily customers having a strong presence and connection to the Baltic countries. When focusing on \\r\\nserving Baltic customers, we continuously aim for a full transparency in customers’ background, availability of KYC data, and economic \\r\\nrationale of activities. Luminor has a zero tolerance towards money laundering, financing of terrorism, and other financial crime. \\r\\nLuminor has developed and implemented a comprehensive set of measures to identify, manage and control its risks. We comply with \\r\\nsanctions laws and follow the guidelines, recommendations and standards issued by regulatory and supervisory authorities and \\r\\nrelevant international organizations, as well as those issued by local banking associations and financial intelligence units in each Baltic \\r\\nstate. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll our anti-financial crime compliance functions are operating at the pan-Baltic level, having competence centers and highly \\r\\nexperienced and certified professionals in the following areas: data protection (DPO), AML (CAMS), Fraud Examiners, FATCA, IT \\r\\ncompliance and digital channels, business integrity, bank products and new product development. Luminor’s Compliance division \\r\\nemploys around 100 professionals, maintaining a robust compliance framework and processes throughout the organization. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 7  \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 31 MARCH 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 May 2019 the Supervisory Council of Luminor has appointed Jonas Eriksson as the CFO and member of the Management Board \\r\\nof Luminor, effective from 1 May 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nBeing capitalised well above the applicable regulatory requirements and internal targets, Luminor Bank has decided to pay out part \\r\\nof the excess capital to its sole shareholder, Luminor Group AB, the main shareholders of which are Nordea Bank Abp and DNB Bank \\r\\nASA. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s current total capital ratio of 20 percent is well above the internal target of 17 percent. The internal target is deemed \\r\\nsufficient to meet all regulatory requirements and the capital needed to deliver Luminor’s business strategy. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo facilitate the distribution, Luminor Group as the sole shareholder of Luminor Bank, made a decision on 28 May 2019 to approve \\r\\nLuminor Bank converting part of its share premium to share capital via a bonus share issuance, followed by a share capital reduction \\r\\nto effect the distribution. Luminor has received regulatory approval from the European Central Bank for such actions. The distribution \\r\\nwill be paid once the legal waiting period of 3 months has elapsed. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the completion of the bonus issue and the subsequent reduction of share capital, the share capital of Luminor Bank AS will \\r\\nremain on the same level as it is now at EUR 34 912 230. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 8  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Results \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries through the Estonian \\r\\nregistered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all assets and liabilities \\r\\nof three Banks have been consolidated as of 2 January 2019. The 2018 comparable figures in Q1 2019 interim report of Luminor Bank \\r\\nAS include also the financial results of the Luminor Bank Latvia and Luminor Bank Lithuania, as if they had been merged prior to 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit earned in the first quarter 2019 was EUR 26.4 million, down EUR 7.0 million compared to the same period in 2018. As \\r\\nannounced earlier in February this year, Luminor has entered its next phase of transformation and is changing its operating model. \\r\\nTo accelerate this transformation, the new model foresees simplifying the bank’s business processes and reorganizing duplicated \\r\\nfunctions and areas, where new technological approaches and organizational solutions are being introduced. As a part of the process, \\r\\nLuminor is also decreasing team size and has filed collective redundancy notification. This has resulted in an increase of total operating \\r\\nexpenses in the first quarter by EUR 2.1 million compared to the same period in 2018. Total operating expenses were EUR 59.6 million, \\r\\nincluding net reversal on loans to customers EUR 7.5 million and extraordinary expenses EUR 17.2 million mostly related to IT expenses \\r\\n(43%), staff expenses (32%) and other transformation costs (25%). \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time underlying business performance contributed positively to the results. Interest income was up EUR 1 million during \\r\\nthe quarter compared to the same period prior year. The loans to deposits ratio improved by 16% compared to the same period in \\r\\n2018, from 142.6% to 120.1% in first quarter 2019, due to increase in deposit volumes. However, higher deposit volumes also \\r\\ncontributed to an increase in interest expenses by EUR 1.6 million. \\r\\n\\r\\nKEY FIGURES OF LUMINOR*  \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR Q1 2019 Q1 2018 2018 FY** \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit 26 367 33 407 124 949 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity 1 810 069 1 707 822 1 757 148 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) % 5.9 7.9 7.1 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets 14 725 789 14 842 924 15 201 023 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) % 0.7 0.9 0.8 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 65 980 66 766 259 733 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets 14 374 728 14 471 261 14 844 146 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) % 1.9 1.9 1.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio (C/I) % 77.2 61.9 62.3 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio %*** -0.26 0.02 -0.06 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet loans 11 282 787 11 587 126 11 472 138 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 9 391 341 8 123 965 9 069 885 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to Deposits ratio % 120.1 142.6 126.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio % 20.0  17.6 18.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio (gross) % 4.6  5.5  5.3 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n* Quarterly ratios and Jan-March 2019 ratios (ROE, ROA, NIM, C/I, Credit impairment ratio) have been expressed on an annualized basis \\r\\n\\r\\n**Luminor Group AB full year consolidated figures     \\r\\n\\r\\n***If loan recoveries prevail, ratio is negative \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 9  \\r\\n\\r\\nExplanations  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity (belonging to owners of company) = (equity at end of reporting period + equity at end of previous period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) = Net profit / Average equity * 100%  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets = (assets at end of reporting period + assets at end of previous period) / 2  \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) = Net profit / Assets, average * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets = (interest-earning assets at end of reporting period + interest-earning assets at end of previous period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) = Net interest income / Interest earning assets, average * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio = Total operating expenses / Total net income * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio = Net losses/reversal on loans to customers / Net loans, average * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio = Loans to customers / Deposits from customers * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio = Common Equity Tier 1 Capital/ Risk-weighted Assets \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio = Gross impaired Loans (Stage 3 loans) / Gross Loans * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLENDING AND DEPOSITS  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers totaled EUR 11.3 billion at the end of first quarter, down 2% from previous quarter.

Deposits from customers are the main funding source for \\r\\nLuminor and make up EUR 9.4 billion or 66.4% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity, as at first quarter 2019. Additionally, \\r\\nLuminor has outstanding debt securities and funding from parent banks, among other items. The funding base is predominantly EUR-\\r\\ndenominated. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2018 Moody’s assigned Luminor Bank AS Senior Unsecured Medium-Term Note Program rating of Baa2. The assignment \\r\\nof rating was followed by a 350 million senior unsecured inaugural public bond issue with a maturity of 3 years and coupon of 1.50%. \\r\\nThe bond is listed on the Euronext Dublin Stock Exchange. Despite the market turbulence at the time of issuance, Luminor was able \\r\\nto attract investors around Europe, supported by strong local demand. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at the end of first quarter 2019, utilized parent funding amounts to EUR 2,048 million and is provided by the two parent banks in \\r\\nthe form of a syndicate, where each parent bank provides 50%. Long-term funding was committed for 6 years (4+2), starting from the \\r\\n1 October 2017, when Luminor was established, and short-term funding is in the form of revolving credit of 364 days. In addition to \\r\\nthe outstanding utilized funding, there is also a committed credit line of EUR 2,456 million in place. When Luminor attracts external \\r\\nwholesale long-term (over one-year term) funding, the equal amount of parent funding will be amortized. \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no changes to Luminor’s ratings in the first quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) for Luminor was 131.2% at the end of the first quarter 2019, according to the Delegated Act’s LCR \\r\\ndefinition. The liquidity buffer is composed of highly liquid central bank eligible securities and cash. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of first quarter, Luminor’s NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio) was 122.0% using a RSF (Required Stable Funding) factor of 65% \\r\\nfor qualifying collateralized mortgages. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 14  \\r\\n\\r\\n(percentage) Q1  2019* Q4 2018* Q3 2018* Q2 2018* Q1  2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 131.2% 189.0% 130.4% 131.1% 140.7% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR** 122.0% 114.0% 106.4% 114.0% 108.0% \\r\\n\\r\\n* Luminor Group AB consolidated figures \\r\\n\\r\\n**mortgages that would qualify for 35% or lower risk weight are calculated with 85% RSF factor, 65% factor implemented since 01.01.2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are pre-dominantly from residents of Baltics.

The Total Capital ratio of Luminor was 20.0% as at the end of Q1 2019 (Q4 2018: 18.8%), which is comfortably \\r\\nabove the internal target of 17.0%. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Total Capital ratio is fully covered by Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. For calculating Credit and Market risk Luminor is using \\r\\nthe Standardized method in the Capital Adequacy calculations. Operational risk is calculated using the Basic Indicator Approach \\r\\nmethod.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of Q1 2019, the Leverage Ratio, calculated according to CRR, was 12.0% (Q4 2018: 10.4%).

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE INFORMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries through the \\r\\nEstonian registered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all assets \\r\\nand liabilities of three Banks have been consolidated as of 02 January 2019. The 2018 comparatives in 2019 Q1 interim report of \\r\\nLuminor Bank AS include also the financial results of the Luminor Bank Latvia and Luminor Bank Lithuania, as if they had been merged \\r\\nprior to 2018 already. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 March 2019 Luminor Bank AS owned following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Estonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country  \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Latvia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Lithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Liising AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Pensions Estonia AS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Kindlustusmaakler OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Est OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Asset Management IPAS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Finance SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Līzings SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Realm SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Skanstes 12 SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 2 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 3 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 4 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 6 SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n Trioleta SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Industrius UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Intractus UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Lit UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Recurso UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Investiciju \\r\\nvaldymas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Lizingas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (the Bank or the Group) was prepared in accordance with IAS 34 \\r\\nInterim Financial reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed interim financial information does not contain all the \\r\\ninformation and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Luminor Group \\r\\nAB (holding) annual financial statements as at 31 December 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed interim financial information are consistent with those followed \\r\\nin the preparation of the Luminor Group AB (holding) annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, except for \\r\\nthe adoption of new and amended standards as set out below. \\r\\n\\r\\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThis note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on the Group’s financial statements and discloses the new accounting \\r\\npolicies that have been applied from 1 January 2019 below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 “Leases” was issued on 13 January 2016 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The new \\r\\nstandard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. All leases result in the lessee \\r\\nobtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and, if lease payments are made over time, also obtaining financing. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 24  \\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases as is required by IAS 17 and, \\r\\ninstead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Lessees will be required to recognize: (a) assets and liabilities for all leases with \\r\\na term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value; and (b) depreciation of lease assets separately from \\r\\ninterest on lease liabilities in the income statement. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS \\r\\n17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases and account for those two types of leases \\r\\ndifferently. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 \\r\\nmonths or less and do not contain a purchase option (‘short-term leases’), and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low \\r\\nvalue (‘low-value assets’). \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustments recognised on adoption of IFRS 16 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group decided that it will apply the standard using the modified retrospective method and has not restated comparatives for the \\r\\n2018 reporting period. The Group recognized a right of use asset of 30,7 million Euro against a corresponding lease liability in the \\r\\namount of 33,2 million Euro and the impact to the equity as of 1 January 2019 amounts to 2,5 million Euro, decreasing its balance. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease liabilities as at 1 January 2019 is reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of 31 December 2018 as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR Q1 2019  \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating lease commitments disclosed as at 31 December 2018                                              36 656 \\r\\n\\r\\nWeighted average incremental borrowing rate as at 1 January 2019 2,45% \\r\\n\\r\\nDiscounted operating lease commitments at 1 January 2019 31 847 \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\nLess  \\r\\n\\r\\nCommitments relating short-term leases  158 \\r\\n\\r\\nAdd  \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments in optional extension periods not recognized as at 31 December 2018         1 518 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal lease liability recognized as at 1 January 2019 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nOf which are:       \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent lease liabilities   4 201 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-current lease liabilities   29 006 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe recognised right-of-use assets relate to the following types of assets (TEUR):   \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR 31 March 2019  1 January 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nProperties 30 529 30 529 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther assets 94 164 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal right-of-use assets 30 623 30 693 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe change in accounting policy affected the following items in the balance sheet on 1 January 2019 (TEUR):  \\r\\n\\r\\n• property, plant and equipment – increase by 30 257 TEUR \\r\\n\\r\\n• lease liabilities – increase by 33 207 TEUR \\r\\n\\r\\nThe net impact on retained earnings on 1 January 2019 was a decrease of 2,5 million Euro. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 25  \\r\\n\\r\\nAmounts recognized in the statement of financial position and profit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\nSet out below, are the carrying amounts of the Group’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and the movements during the period: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR Properties Other fixed assets Total  right-of use \\r\\n\\r\\nassets \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 01 January 2019 30 529 164 30 693 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditions 1 182 0 1 182 1 182 \\r\\n\\r\\nReductions -110 -58 -168 -168 \\r\\n\\r\\nDepreciation expense -1 072 -12 -1 084 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest expense 0 0 0 147 \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments 0 0 0 -898 \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 March 2019 30 529 94 30 623 33 471 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognised rent expense from short-term leases, leases of low-value assets and variable lease payments of totally 500 \\r\\nthousand Euros for the 3 months ended 31 March 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nPractical expedients applied \\r\\n\\r\\nIn applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:   \\r\\n\\r\\n the use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics;  \\r\\n\\r\\n the accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 January 2019 as short-term \\r\\nleases.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s leasing activities and how these are accounted for \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group leases various offices and other assets (IT equipment and cars). Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 4 \\r\\nto15 years but may have extension options as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide \\r\\nrange of different terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 2018 financial year, leases of property, IT equipment and cars were classified as either finance or operating leases. Payments \\r\\nmade under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) were charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis \\r\\nover the period of the lease.   \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 January 2019, leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset \\r\\nis available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged \\r\\nto profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for \\r\\neach period.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease payments are discounted using the \\r\\ninterest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate \\r\\nthat the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment \\r\\nwith similar terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo determine incremental borrowing rate we have considered: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. existing borrowings (own funding cost) that need to be adjusted for amount, security, term etc. and \\r\\n2. property yield that need to be adjusted for term, amount, quality of property, potential weighted average cost of capital \\r\\n\\r\\n(WACC) element in yields etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor property leases we have decided the usage of the Bank’s own funding cost as a discount rate. For other assets we use the interest \\r\\nrate implicit in the lease as discount rate, as it is readily determinable. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the lease liability by:  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 26  \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;  \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and  \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications (like changes in lease term, in the assessment \\r\\nof an option to purchase the underlying asset, in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, in future \\r\\nlease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, including for example a change to \\r\\nreflect changes in market rental rates following a market rent review and in floating interest rates, or to reflect revised in-substance \\r\\nfixed lease payments (payments are structured as variable lease payments, but there is no genuine variability in those payments and \\r\\nthose payments contain variable clauses that do not have real economic substance). \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured applying a cost model. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost of the right-of-use asset comprises: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that \\r\\ndate; \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(d) an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it \\r\\nis located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are \\r\\nincurred to produce inventories. The lessee incurs the obligation for those costs either at the commencement date or as a \\r\\nconsequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the right-of-use asset measured at cost: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications, or to \\r\\nreflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in \\r\\nprofit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment and small \\r\\nitems of office furniture below 5 000 EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nEstimation uncertainty arising from variable lease payments \\r\\n\\r\\nSome property leases contain variable payment terms that are linked to consumer price index. The management has assessed that \\r\\neffect from the consumer price index change is not material to the lease payments. \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These terms are \\r\\nused to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. The majority of extension and termination options held are \\r\\nexercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn determining the lease term, the management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise \\r\\nan extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included \\r\\nin the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). Potential future cash outflows have not been \\r\\nincluded in the lease liability because it is not reasonably certain that the leases will be extended (or not terminated).   \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 27  \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, and the \\r\\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are \\r\\nbased on management’s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable \\r\\nunder the circumstances. Management also makes certain judgements, apart from those involving estimations, in the process of \\r\\napplying the accounting policies. Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated \\r\\nfinancial statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the \\r\\nnext financial year include: \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 9 fundamentally changed the credit loss recognition methodology. The standard replaced IAS 39’s incurred loss approach with a \\r\\nforward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans \\r\\nand other debt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The allowance \\r\\nis based on the expected credit losses associated with the probability of default in the next twelve months unless there has been a \\r\\nsignificant increase in credit risk since origination, in which case, the allowance is based on the probability of default over the life of \\r\\nthe asset. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for purchased or originated credit-impaired \\r\\nassets (POCI) regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument. The Bank has established a policy to perform \\r\\nan assessment at the end of each reporting period of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by \\r\\nconsidering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bank’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable \\r\\ninputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include: \\r\\n\\r\\n evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1, 2 or 3;  \\r\\n\\r\\n assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including the \\r\\nvarious formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\r\\n the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) \\r\\nand exposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\r\\n determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;  \\r\\n\\r\\n estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic and \\r\\npessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios; and \\r\\n\\r\\n estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for Stage 3 individual assessments and assigning probabilities to those \\r\\nscenarios \\r\\n\\r\\nThe assets to test for impairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes assets \\r\\nwhere there has been no significant increase in credit risk or which are classified as low risk (rating categorised as “Investment grade” \\r\\nor higher), stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets. \\r\\nSignificant assets in stage 3 are tested for impairment on an individual basis, while for insignificant assets a collective assessment is \\r\\nperformed. In stage 1, the allowances equal the 12-month expected credit loss. In stage 2 and 3, the allowances equal the lifetime \\r\\nexpected credit losses.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOne important driver for size of allowances under IFRS 9 is the trigger for transferring an asset from Stage 1 to Stage 2. Luminor uses \\r\\na mix of absolute and relative changes (0.6 p.p. and 2.5 times) in 12-month point-in-time Probability of Default (PD) to determine \\r\\nwhether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

The swaps are being used to hedge the \\r\\nexposure to changes in the fair value of its fixed rate 1.50% senior unsecured bond. Trade date is 10 October 2018, effective date is \\r\\n18 October 2018 and maturity date is 18 October 2021 for both interest swap agreements. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instruments as the terms of the interest rate swaps \\r\\nmatch the terms of the fixed rate loan (i.e. notional amount maturity payment and reset dates). The Group has established a hedge \\r\\nratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships, as the underlying risk of the interest rate swaps is identical to the hedged risk component. \\r\\nTo test hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the \\r\\nhedging instrument against the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 31  \\r\\n\\r\\nHedge ineffectiveness can theoretically arise from: \\r\\n\\r\\n A different interest rate curve applied to discount the hedged item and hedging instrument \\r\\n\\r\\n Differences in the timing of cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument, also a different day count \\r\\n\\r\\n The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instrument and hedged item \\r\\n\\r\\n31.03.2019 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 350 000 1 694 Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial during Q1 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 350 000 1 128 Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial during 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\n9.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where \\r\\nthe fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active \\r\\nmarkets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs to \\r\\nthese models are derived from observable market data where possible, but where observable market data is not available, judgment \\r\\nis required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements mentioned techniques were not used extensively \\r\\nas no such financial assets and financial liabilities exist on the statement of financial position of the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of loans to customers, customer deposits, amounts due from credit institutions and amounts due to credit institutions \\r\\nand other financial assets and liabilities’ obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the rates \\r\\ncurrently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn assessing the fair value for financial assets, the management has performed a discounted cash flow analysis; up-to-date market \\r\\ninformation at the assessment moment is being used for assessing cash flows. For loans where base interest rates are pegged to \\r\\nfloating market interest rates, the Group has considered the difference between the average interest margin of issued loans and the \\r\\naverage interest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has been changed (increased) \\r\\nsince issuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal to the fair value. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of financial liabilities at amortized cost such as Loans and deposits from credit institutions and Deposits from customers, \\r\\nwhich are not on demand, have been estimated based on the discounted cash flow model using interest rates for similar products as \\r\\nat year end.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by IFRS 8. In Luminor, the CODM has been defined as Group Executive Management. The \\r\\nExecutive Management Committee monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions \\r\\nabout resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss and is \\r\\nmeasured consistently with operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of \\r\\nexpenses after internal funds transfer pricing, as management primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a \\r\\nperformance measure. Fees & commission income for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made \\r\\nbetween different product categories for segment reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments (including \\r\\ninternal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Other segment) and income and expenses not booked on \\r\\ncustomer level, which are allocated between the operating segments. Only assets and liabilities relating to customers who belong to \\r\\nthe operating segments are reported under the respective segments, all other balance sheet items are reported under Other segment. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 39  \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 March 2019, as part of implementing new operating model, Luminor Group implemented new reportable operating segments, \\r\\ntherefore previous periods data is not fully comparable in respective segments. Results from 1 January 2019 to 28 February 2019 \\r\\nwere adjusted to reflect the new operating segments. \\r\\n\\r\\nREPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth Management. \\r\\nThe segment reporting is based on a combination of organizational structure and customer service model. \\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate Banking segment services business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager. Retail Banking segment services \\r\\nbusiness customers without a dedicated relationship manager and private individuals not belonging to Wealth Management segment. \\r\\nWealth Management services wealthy private individuals and holding companies associated with those individuals. Results of other \\r\\noperating segments below the quantitative thresholds set in IFRS 8 which are not allocated to main business segments are included \\r\\nin Other segment. \\r\\n\\r\\n Corporate \\r\\n\\r\\nBanking \\r\\nRetail Banking \\r\\n\\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement \\r\\nOther Total \\r\\n\\r\\nQ1 2019      \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 31 022 30 341 1 997 2 620 65 980 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet fees & commission income 6 688 10 906 531 588 18 714 \\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income 2 932 1 465 96 443 4 936 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther income 32 488 0 2 122 2 642 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal income 40 675 43 200 2 623 5 773 92 272 \\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel costs  administrative costs and \\r\\n\\r\\ndepreciation  \\r\\n\\r\\n-23 006 -43 668 -1 678 696 -67 657 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (losses/ reversal) on loans \\r\\n\\r\\nto customers \\r\\n\\r\\n474 7 086 39 -114 7 485 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther 0 0 0 -4 090 -4 090 \\r\\n\\r\\nProfit before Tax 18 142 6 618 985 2 265 28 010 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\n31.03.2019      \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets      \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 5 122 348 6 254 798 90 448 -184 806 11 282 787 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  5 122 348 6 254 798 90 448 -184 806 11 282 787 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities      \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 4 896 221 3 640 005 848 407 4 085 9 388 718 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  4 896 221 3 640 005 848 407 4 085 9 388 718 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 40  \\r\\n\\r\\n Corporate \\r\\n\\r\\nBanking \\r\\nRetail Banking \\r\\n\\r\\nWealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement \\r\\nOther Total \\r\\n\\r\\nQ1 2018      \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 32 874 29 291 1 555 3 046 66 766 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet fees & commission income 7 289 11 511 524 928 20 252 \\r\\n\\r\\nTrading income 2 418 1 389 61 532 4 401 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther income 213 274 0 1 098 1 585 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal income 42 794 42 465 2 141 5 605 93 004 \\r\\n\\r\\nPersonnel costs  administrative costs and \\r\\n\\r\\ndepreciation  \\r\\n\\r\\n-16 659 -33 547 -1 330 -5 285 -56 822 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet impairment (losses/ reversal) on loans \\r\\n\\r\\nto customers \\r\\n\\r\\n-4 185 1 169 -2 2 310 -709 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther 0 0 0 -1 193 -1 193 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating profit 21 949 10 087 808 1 436 34 280 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018      \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets      \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and receivables 5 270 357 6 296 954 92 801 -187 974 11 472 138 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  5 270 357 6 296 954 92 801 -187 974 11 472 138 \\r\\n\\r\\n      \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities      \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 4 783 549 3 559 706 722 684 3 946 9 069 885 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  4 783 549 3 559 706 722 684 3 946 9 069 885 \\r\\n\\r\\n17. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s shareholders made a decision on 28 May 2019 to carry out a bonus share issue, followed by a reduction of share capital. \\r\\nThe bonus share issue is based on the bank’s interim balance sheet as of January 2, 2019 and involves a partial conversion of share \\r\\npremium in the amount of EUR 216,030,920 into share capital. Following the bonus issue, the share capital of the bank shall be \\r\\nreduced by the same amount and is subject to pay-out to the shareholder after the expiry of a statutory waiting period of at least \\r\\nthree months. The pending reduction will be fully taken into account when calculating capital ratios after the decision date.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the pay-out Luminor will continue to be capitalized above all regulatory requirements and the internal targets.  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Condensed consolidated interim financial statements  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 March 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 41  \\r\\n\\r\\nCONTACT DETAILS \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS \\r\\n\\r\\nLocation and address Liivalaia 45 \\r\\n\\r\\n10145 Tallinn  \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nMain activity: \\r\\n\\r\\nCommercial Register code \\r\\n\\r\\nTelephone \\r\\n\\r\\nFax \\r\\n\\r\\nNordea SWIFT/BIC \\r\\n\\r\\nDNB SWIFT/BIC \\r\\n\\r\\nWebsite \\r\\n\\r\\nE-mail \\r\\n\\r\\nBalance sheet date \\r\\n\\r\\nReporting period  \\r\\n\\r\\nReporting currency \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Estonia \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit institution \\r\\n\\r\\n11315936 \\r\\n\\r\\n+372 628 3300 \\r\\n\\r\\n+372 628 3201 \\r\\n\\r\\nNDEAEE2X \\r\\n\\r\\nRIKOEE22 \\r\\n\\r\\nwww.luminor.ee \\r\\n\\r\\ninfo@luminor.ee \\r\\n\\r\\n31 March 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n01.01.2019 – 31.03.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nEuro \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.luminor.ee/\\r\\nfile://///dnbl.sise/dfs/Shares/books/Reporting/Eesti%20Pank%20Reports/2018/Interim%20Reports_Vahearuanded/Q2/IAS%2034/Interim%20reporting/info@luminor.ee\",\n",

By simplifying our structure and \\r\\nour decision-making process, consolidating our IT, and strengthening our controls, we have become a more efficient organisation. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe gain continuous support from the strong macro conditions and stable operating environment that the Baltic states are enjoying \\r\\nright now, and from the concentrated and regionally harmonising banking market. The Baltic states today are among the most \\r\\ndynamic economies of the European Union, offering exceptionally exciting financial opportunities that are at the same time backed \\r\\nby the security of the euro area.   \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second quarter, the Luminor retail banking team sped up the transformation of the customer service model and opened \\r\\ncustomer service centres operating under a new concept. The efficiency of the pan-Baltic model has also been demonstrated by \\r\\nsuccessful common marketing campaigns and improved management of sales channels, which has helped us to achieve growth of \\r\\n13% in the deposit portfolio over the same period of last year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luminor corporate banking team has meanwhile overseen the growth of the deposit portfolio of corporate clients for the third \\r\\nquarter in a row, as deposit volumes were 11% larger in the second quarter than in the same period of 2018.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus of the wealth management team on growing the business and increasing customer satisfaction has increased the pension \\r\\nassets under management in the Baltics by 11% and assets under management by 25% from what they were in the second quarter of \\r\\nlast year.   \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have also put in motion the transfer of customer data and services in Latvia and Lithuania to the unified Luminor system, with the \\r\\nfirst customers having been successfully moved to the unified systems. Our digital team is working hard to develop the new Luminor \\r\\ndigital channels and prepare our current channels for the process of transferring customer data. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is continuously committed to preventing money laundering and terrorist financing through the prevention, detection, and \\r\\nreporting of unusual activities, and we have developed and implemented a robust financial crime risk management framework to \\r\\nfulfil this commitment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2018, Blackstone, one of the world’s leading investment funds, signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake in \\r\\nLuminor. The process of gaining regulatory approval from the European Central Bank and locally is progressing well and it is expected \\r\\nthat this transaction will be closed during the second half of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has also widened its investor base further, issuing its second public senior unsecured bond of 300 million euros in June, \\r\\ntaking yet another important step towards becoming a self-funded, independent pan-Baltic bank. The bond issue attracted 75 \\r\\nindividual investors from across Europe, of which more than 80% were non-Baltic accounts. The scale of the investors’ interest proves \\r\\nthat Luminor’s financial profile is strong and that Luminor as a credit institution is viewed across a broad European investor universe \\r\\nas a solid and emerging investment case.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is well on track with its transformation programme that will see it grow into a leading independent Baltic financial service \\r\\nprovider that is a partner to companies and to financially active people with an entrepreneurial mind-set. \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n4 \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nOverview \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor (Luminor Bank AS) was established on 1 October 2017 by the merger of the operations in the Baltic states of DNB Bank ASA \\r\\n(Commercial Register no. 984 851 006) and Nordea Bank AB (currently Nordea Bank Abp, as Nordea has been domiciled in Finland \\r\\nsince 1 October 2018 following the cross-border reversed merger between Nordea Bank AB (publ) and Nordea Bank Abp, registration \\r\\nno. 2858394-9) to create a new-generation financial service provider for local businesses and  financially active people.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with approximately 1 million clients, 2566 employees, and \\r\\nmarket share of 16.4% in deposits and 20.2% in lending as at the end of the second quarter of 2019. Total shareholders’ equity \\r\\namounts to EUR 1.6 billion and Luminor is capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 18%. Luminor’s vision is to become the best financial \\r\\necosystem for its customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn agreement was signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank AB  and the US-based private equity firm \\r\\nBlackstone to sell a majority stake in Luminor. As part of the transaction, Blackstone will acquire a 60% majority stake in the bank. \\r\\nNordea and DNB will retain equal 20% equity stakes in Luminor and will continue to support the bank with long-term funding, \\r\\nexpertise, and ongoing representation on the Supervisory Council. Additionally, Blackstone has entered into an agreement with \\r\\nNordea to purchase their remaining 20% stake over the coming years. Closing of the transaction is subject to the approval of the \\r\\nEuropean Central Bank and local supervisory authorities and is expected to occur in the second half of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers a wide range of products and services to its customers through all possible channels, digital and physical, with 38 \\r\\ncustomer service centres and four meet-up points in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia combined.

This has left a notable mark on \\r\\nthe protracted soft patch in the global manufacturing sector and continues to depress economic sentiment. Manufacturing confidence \\r\\nin particular has been affected the most, with weakness expected to extend into the second half of the year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic states, together with some CEE peers like Slovakia, are today among the most dynamic economies of the EU. During the \\r\\nlast two years the economies of the euro area, including those of the Baltic states, have enjoyed a strong and broadly based recovery \\r\\nreflected in above-trend growth and tightening labour markets. The average yearly growth rate for 2017-18 exceeded 4% in Estonia \\r\\nand Latvia, and was a robust 3.8% in Lithuania, while the average growth in GDP in the euro area was close to 2%.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth is set to start moderating gradually, albeit from a high level, but labour markets will still be firm and tight even as European \\r\\neconomies go through the current soft patch in the global trade cycle. Growth in GDP in the euro area decelerated noticeably last \\r\\nautumn to only 1.2% year on year and 0.2% over the quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018, as industry and trade made a weaker \\r\\ncontribution. However, the euro area economies managed to resist any further moderation in momentum in the spring with growth \\r\\nin the first quarter slightly exceeding expectations at 1.2% over the year and 0.4% over the quarter. Against this softer external \\r\\nbackdrop the Baltic states have so far resisted the disruptions to global trade and sustained their strong and broadly based economic \\r\\nmomentum in the first quarter, benefiting not least from investments and exports. Estonia posted yearly growth of 4.6% in the first \\r\\nquarter, Latvia of 3.2%, and Lithuania of 3.8%, meaning they remained among the fastest growing economies in the euro area.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe external sector will weigh on growth in the open Baltic economies and it is likely that export revenues will taper until there is a \\r\\nrecovery in global trade and confidence. We expect only a gradual moderation of growth given the continued support from strong \\r\\nlabour markets and healthy domestic demand, which remain the key engines of growth.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite slightly weaker confidence in industry, exports have so far predominantly resisted the weakness in external markets and \\r\\nexpanded at a healthy pace, especially in Estonia and Lithuania. Latvia continues to exceed expectations with strong performance in \\r\\ninvestment, which benefits from EU structural funds and the appetite of industry for investments to enhance productivity. This could \\r\\npartly help to offset the headwinds from slower growth in key trading partners, including the euro area and the Nordic countries. \\r\\nOverall, growth in the Baltic states will continue to be supported by rising wages, fading inflationary pressures and further, albeit \\r\\nslower, gains in employment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nActivities \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor completed its cross-border merger on 2 January 2019 and continues its operations in all the three Baltic states through the \\r\\nbank headquartered in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all the assets, rights and \\r\\nliabilities of Luminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank \\r\\ncontinues its activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches. A new organisational set up and a new \\r\\ngovernance structure were also introduced, and new members of management bodies were appointed. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe deposits and financial instruments of the depositors and customers who use the investment services of Luminor Bank AS Latvian \\r\\nbranch and Luminor Bank AS Lithuanian branch are guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and investor protection scheme established \\r\\nand operated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to roll out the new operating model during the second quarter by simplifying its structure and decision-making \\r\\nprocess, unifying and executing IT consolidation, strengthening its controls, and becoming more efficient, more resilient and more \\r\\nresolvable. These developments meant the Luminor team was reduced by some 200 employees during the second quarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second quarter Luminor started transfering customer data and services to the unified Luminor system in Latvia and Lithuania. \\r\\nThe first customers have been moved successfully to the unified systems, and this work will continue until the end of the year. The \\r\\ndigital team continued their efforts in developing the new Luminor digital channels and preparing our current channels for the process \\r\\nof transferring customer data. The main purpose of this process is to offer similar functionality to those customers who are transferred, \\r\\nand to secure smooth and uninterrupted services for the customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n6 \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was announced that Luminor will disable access to digital channels using code cards from 10 September. Customers are encouraged \\r\\nto use modern digital authorisation tools instead and are offered help in starting to use them.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team carried out a solid transformation in its distribution channels in the second quarter and improved efficiency in \\r\\nrelated areas. Ten locations in the customer service network were closed, and two others were transformed into meet-up points. \\r\\nLuminor continued to roll out its new customer service model and opened new concept customer service centres in Riga and Tallinn. \\r\\nAt the end of the second quarter, Luminor was able to serve its customers in a total of 42 locations across the Baltics.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCashless solutions were introduced in customer centres for Lithuania and Estonia during the reporting period, as the process of \\r\\nautomating cash handling was implemented in Lithuania, and it is planned that the solution will be expanded to Estonia during the next \\r\\nquarter. The centralisation of consumer lending was completed during the period, so the bank now has a unified approach to consumer \\r\\nlending products, their terms and conditions, and lending procedures for its customers in all the Baltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBy running pan-Baltic sales and marketing campaigns and improving management of sales channels, the retail banking team has \\r\\nsucceeded in growing the deposit portfolio by 13% from the same quarter of last year. The new lending volumes for retail customers \\r\\nremained stable during the quarter.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe migration of the first pilot group of customers to the unified bank platform has been completed in Latvia and Lithuania. The change \\r\\nfrom code cards to other authorisation tools has been rolled out and at the end of the second quarter, 45% of internet bank sign-in \\r\\nsessions were ensured by Smart-ID authorisation. Increasing the use of this tool remains the top priority, as it is one of the fundamental \\r\\nfactors for successful sales through remote channels in the rest of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second quarter of 2019 the Corporate Banking team continued to focus on increasing the profitability of our corporate lending \\r\\nportfolio. This led to a reduction of 10% in outstanding loan volumes from the second quarter of 2018. The growth of the deposit \\r\\nportfolio of corporate clients maintained its pace for the third quarter in a row, and deposit volumes were 11% larger in the second \\r\\nquarter of 2019 than in the same quarter of 2018.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoan loss provisions increased to EUR 11.6m in the second quarter as the outlook worsened for Latvia’s subsidised energy sector and \\r\\nbecause of additional provisions in the Estonian NPL book. The macro environment continues to be very supportive. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe new operating model and the latest developments in the banking market were presented to corporate clients at a series of \\r\\ncorporate banking events across all the Baltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main focus in Wealth Management in the second quarter was on growing the business, ensuring high customer satisfaction and \\r\\nexecuting changes in the Pan-Baltic operating model. Collaboration with other business segments supported both growth and customer \\r\\nsatisfaction.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second half of May, functional managers were selected and appointed for the Asset Management & Pension team. The orderly \\r\\ntransfer of responsibilities will be orchestrated by the end of the third quarter with the reappointment of memberships of local \\r\\nmanagement boards of pension companies and in consultation with local supervising authorities.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pension assets under management in the Baltics reached EUR 1.32 billion in the second quarter of 2019, up 11% on the same \\r\\nquarter of 2018. Luminor had 292 thousand second pillar and 62 thousand third pillar pension customers at the end of the quarter.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking focuses on growing the assets under management and ensuring a high level of customer satisfaction by helping affluent \\r\\nand high net worth individuals and their families to grow, manage and preserve their wealth. During the quarter the Private Banking \\r\\nteam focused on attracting new customers from the market. Collaboration and information-sharing with Luminor’s other business \\r\\nsegments helped to deliver the results. In the second quarter of 2019, there was 25% more in assets under management than in the \\r\\nsame quarter of 2018.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor aims to become the financial partner in the Baltics for the local way of living and doing business. An important part of achieving \\r\\nthis is to take account of corporate governance, social conditions and the environment in all the bank’s activities.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe stand for sustainability, diversity and equal rights. Luminor is not party to any infringement of human or labour rights, corruption, \\r\\nenvironmental harm or other actions that could be regarded as unethical.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are accountable to society and the environment and we expect the same from our partners, having included our Rules of Social \\r\\nResponsibility as part of all our Cooperation Agreements.  \\r\\n\\r\\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORTS \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor does not tolerate money laundering, financing of terrorism or any other financial crimes. Luminor has developed and \\r\\nimplemented a robust financial crime risk management framework to prevent, detect, manage and report financial crime risk \\r\\neffectively. The framework consists of financial crime detection technology, comprehensive policies and procedures, regular risk \\r\\nassessments, training and awareness-raising, and ongoing monitoring of new and developing financial crime risks. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor complies with all applicable legislation on anti-money laundering, combating terrorist financing and sanctions. In addition, \\r\\nLuminor follows and implements international guidelines, recommendations and standards issued by the regulatory and supervisory \\r\\nauthorities, relevant international bodies, local banking associations and financial intelligence units in each Baltic state. Luminor \\r\\ncontinuously invests in its systems and improves its processes to combat financial crime in a constantly changing environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor primarily serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers with a strong personal or business connection to the \\r\\nBaltic states. As such, Luminor’s risk appetite statements reflect the need for full transparency of the background of Luminor customers, \\r\\nthe availability of KYC data, and the economic rationale for the activities of customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supervisory Council of Luminor approved the AML/CFT Standards, Sanctions Standards and Risk Appetite Statements that define: \\r\\n\\r\\n- Absolute limitations, where Luminor will not under any conditions establish a relationship with the customer;\\r\\n\\r\\n- Conditional risk limitations subject to authorised approval, where Luminor will only establish and retain a relationship with\\r\\nthe customer if it is reviewed and approved by the designated Customer Risk Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 140 professionals in Luminor’s Compliance Division and Customer Data Quality Middle Office maintain and ensure a robust \\r\\ncompliance framework and processes throughout the organisation. More than 15 professionals are internationally certified AML \\r\\nspecialists (CAMS), Certified Fraud Examiners (CFE), Certified Internal Auditors (CIA) and certified Compliance Officers. \\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 80 internal training and awareness-raising events were organised in the first half of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 30 JUNE 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Shareholders’ Meeting of Luminor Bank AS accepted the requests of Nadine Faruque and Ari Kaperi to resign from the bank’s  \\r\\nSupervisory Council. The resignation of Ari Kaperi is effective as of 1 July 2019 and the resignation of Nadine Faruque is effective as of 11 \\r\\nJuly 2019 (see Note 17). \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 July 2019, Luminor sold its property holding company SIA Skanstes 12 (Latvia) to the investment company Colonna. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n8 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Results \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter completing its cross-border merger at the beginning of the year, Luminor continues its operations in all the Baltic states through \\r\\nthe Estonian registered bank Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. Luminor has entered the next phase of its \\r\\ntransformation and changed its operating model starting from 1 March. By consolidating its technological platforms, right-sizing the \\r\\nbusiness, simplifying the product and service portfolio and increasing efficiency, the bank aims to accelerate the transformation to \\r\\nbuilding and executing areas of superior customer experience. As a consequence of this process, the financial results of Luminor are \\r\\naffected by the exceptional and restructuring costs of investing in technology and reducing team sizes. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second quarter net profit reached EUR 6.7 million and was EUR 36.9 million lower than in the same period of 2018. Net interest \\r\\nincome declined by 0.4%, while net loans declined by 6.5% as a result of planned activities that aim to ensure fair and rational pricing \\r\\nof risk, and to improve profitability. The change in financing volumes has also affected net fee and commission income, which was \\r\\n3.5% lower than in the second quarter of last year. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses in the second quarter were EUR 68.7 million and were EUR 14.4 million higher than in the same quarter of \\r\\nlast year. Like in the first quarter, operating expenses were mainly driven by transformation costs and net impairment on loans to \\r\\ncustomers. Exceptional expenses were EUR 0.9 million higher than in the first quarter and reached EUR 18.1 million, the major part \\r\\nof which were IT expenses, accounting for 85%, followed by staff expenses with 5% and other transformation costs with 10%. \\r\\nImpairment of loans to customers and other assets during the second quarter reached EUR 12.3 million as a result of changed \\r\\nassumptions used in the quarterly loan assessment process. Impairment was driven by large exposures in the legacy portfolio, while \\r\\nthe credit quality of new lending remains good and is facilitated by the current macroeconomic outlook. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe funding position continued to improve during the second quarter. The loan-to-deposit ratio improved to 117.1% from 142.7% a \\r\\nyear ago. The improved funding gap was supported by a reduction in loans of EUR 769 million and an increase in deposits of EUR 1.1 \\r\\nbillion over the past 12 months.

This reduction came from write-offs, repayments, and loans returning to \\r\\nperforming.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe allowances for on-balance sheet exposures amounted to EUR 174.7 million or 1.6% of the total loan portfolio, which was up EUR \\r\\n1.5 million on the previous quarter. The effect comes from a decrease of EUR 2.0 million in allowances for performing (Stage 1 and \\r\\nStage 2) loans and an increase of EUR 3.5 million in allowances for impaired (Stage 3) loans, which is mainly impacted by one customer \\r\\nin Estonia. The level of allowances on the impaired loans was 28.4% at the end of second quarter of 2019, which was 3.3 pp higher \\r\\nthan in the previous quarter because of a reduction in the impaired loans

Deposits from customers are the main source of funding \\r\\nfor Luminor and make up EUR 9.3 billion or 66.9% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity at the end of the second quarter of 2019. \\r\\nThe fundingbase is predominantly EUR-denominated. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the deposits, Luminor also has outstanding debt securities and funding from parent banks constituting a substantional \\r\\npart of the funding base. On 11 June 2019, Luminor Bank AS issued three-year and four-month public senior unsecured preferred \\r\\nbonds worth EUR 300 million under the European Medium Term Note (EMTN) Programme. The bonds are listed on the Euronext \\r\\nStock Exchange. Appetite from investors was very strong, generating orders in excess of EUR 600 million that enabled Luminor to \\r\\nissue bonds worth EUR 300 million at a spread over mid-swap of 167 bps, tightening pricing by 13 bps from initial pricing indications. \\r\\nGiven the low euro interest rates, the final coupon rate of the bonds was fixed at 1.375% and the yield ended at 1.42%. More than \\r\\n80% of orders, worth nearly EUR 500 million, originated from outside the Baltics. As at Q2 2019 the bonds outstanding under the \\r\\nEMTN programme amount to a total of EUR 650 million, with the transaction of 11 June 2019 building on the inaugural transaction \\r\\nof EUR 350 million from October 2018. The Senior Unsecured Medium-Term Note Program is assigned a rating of Baa2 by Moody’s. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at the end of the second quarter of 2019, funding from parents amounted to EUR 1,838 million and was provided by the two parent \\r\\nbanks in the form of a syndicate, where each parent bank provides 50%. Long-term funding is committed for 6 years (4+2) starting \\r\\nfrom 1 October 2017, when Luminor was established. Short-term funding is in the form of revolving credit of 364 days. In addition to \\r\\nthe outstanding funding utilised, there is also a committed unused credit line of EUR 2,366 million in place. EUR 300 million of parent \\r\\nfunding was amortised in June after the senior unsecured issuance under the European Medium Term Note (EMTN) Programme.  \\r\\n\\r\\nRating \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, \\r\\nwith a stable outlook. There has been no changes to Luminor’s ratings. \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor uses different metrics to measure liquidity risk. One metric used is the LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio). The LCR for Luminor \\r\\nwas 132.5% as at the end of the second quarter by the CRR LCR definition. The liquidity buffer is composed of highly liquid central \\r\\nbank eligible securities and cash.

Following the bonus issue, the share capital of the bank was reduced \\r\\nby the same amount. Pay-out to the shareholder is subject to the expiry of a statutory waiting period of at least three months. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continues to have a strong capitalization that is sufficient to ensure the financial stability of the Group and supply the capital \\r\\nneeded to deliver the business strategy. The Total Capital Ratio of Luminor was 18.0% as at the end of the second quarter of 2019 \\r\\n(following the capital reduction), which is comfortably above the internal target of 17.0%. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Total Capital Ratio is fully covered by Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Luminor uses the Standardised method in the Capital \\r\\nAdequacy calculations to calculate credit and market risk. Operational risk is calculated using the Basic Indicator Approach method.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2019, the Leverage Ratio, calculated using CRR, was 10.6%, and it was 12.0% at the end of the first \\r\\nquarter of 2019. The Leverage Ratio is calculated as the bank’s total Tier 1 own funds divided by its total risk exposure measure, \\r\\nincluding the risk positions on assets and off balance sheet liabilities. \\r\\n\\r\\n1.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n96.9%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.6% 1.9%\\r\\n\\r\\n96.1%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.0% 0.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n96.6%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.9%1.1%\\r\\n\\r\\n96.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.1%\\r\\n\\r\\nBaltic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania Other EU Non-EU \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n16 \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital ratios \\r\\n\\r\\nPosition  Q2 2019 Q1 2019 Q4 2018* Q3 2018* Q2 2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital adequacy 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% 17.58% \\r\\n\\r\\nLeverage Ratio 10.59% 12.00% 10.38% 10.68% 10.84% \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 Ratio 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% 17.58% \\r\\n\\r\\nT1 Capital Ratio 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% 17.58% \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Capital Ratio 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% 17.58% \\r\\n\\r\\n* Luminor Group AB consolidated figures \\r\\n\\r\\nOwn funds requirements \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR 30 June 2019 31 December 2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nTOTAL RISK EXPOSURE AMOUNT 8 668 797 9 206 164 \\r\\n\\r\\n1.

The condensed consolidated interim financial information \\r\\ndoes not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction \\r\\nwith the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2018. As described in the section Accounting \\r\\nfor the merger below, following the merger on 02 January 2019, the condensed consolidated interim financial information includes \\r\\nthe financial information for 3 merged banks, therefore for the purpose of obtaining annual financial information for the same group \\r\\nof entities, we advise the reader to also refer to the consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 \\r\\nof Luminor Bank AS’s parent entity, Luminor Group AB (holding), available at https://www.luminor.ee/en/financial-reports. Those \\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.luminor.ee/en/financial-reports\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n25 \\r\\n\\r\\nconsolidated financial statements represent substantially the financial position and results of the 3 merged banks, with certain minor \\r\\nadditional balances and transactions from Luminor Group AB (holding) entity. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are consistent with \\r\\nthose followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, except \\r\\nfor the additional policy for accounting for the merger, and adoption of new and amended standards as set out below. \\r\\n\\r\\nACCOUNTING FOR THE MERGER \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS do not prescribe method of accounting for transactions under common control. Pursuant to IAS 8, management has determined \\r\\nthat the merger is accounted for using the predecessor method of accounting. Under this method the financial statements are \\r\\npresented as if the businesses had been combined from the beginning of the earliest period presented (or the date that the entities \\r\\nwere brought under common control, if later). The assets and liabilities of the banks transferred under common control are recognised \\r\\nat their predecessor values, i.e at their carrying values from the financial statements at the highest level of consolidation (i.e. Luminor \\r\\nGroup AB (holding)). No new goodwill arises under predecessor method. Any difference between the consideration given and the \\r\\naggregate book value of the assets and liabilities (as of the date of the transaction) of the acquired entity is included in equity. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the completion of the merger on 02 January 2019, all assets and liabilities of Luminor Bank AS, Luminor Bank Latvia and Luminor \\r\\nBank Lithuania have been combined with the retrosepective effect. Therefore, 2018 comparatives in this condensed consolidated \\r\\ninterim financial information of Luminor Bank AS include also the financial results of the Luminor Bank Latvia and Luminor Bank \\r\\nLithuania in accordance with the policy described above.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThis note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on the Group’s financial statements and discloses the new accounting \\r\\npolicies that have been applied from 1 January 2019 below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 “Leases” was issued on 13 January 2016 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The new \\r\\nstandard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. All leases result in the lessee \\r\\nobtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and, if lease payments are made over time, also obtaining financing. \\r\\nAccordingly, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases as was required by IAS 17 and, \\r\\ninstead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Lessees are required to recognize: (a) assets and liabilities for all leases with a \\r\\nterm of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value; and (b) using depreciation of lease assets separately from \\r\\ninterest on lease liabilities in the income statement. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS \\r\\n17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases and account for those two types of leases \\r\\ndifferently.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 \\r\\nmonths or less and do not contain a purchase option (‘short-term leases’), and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low \\r\\nvalue (‘low-value assets’). \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustments recognised on adoption of IFRS 16 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group decided that it will apply the standard using the modified retrospective method and has not restated comparatives for the \\r\\n2018 reporting period. The Group recognized a right of use asset of 30 623 thousand Euro against a corresponding lease liability in \\r\\nthe amount of 33 207 thousand Euro and the impact to the equity as of 1 January 2019 amounts to 2 584 thousand Euro, decreasing \\r\\nits balance. Net impact on equity was caused by the fact that the Group decided to recognise the right-of-use assets at the date of \\r\\ninitial application, measuring them at their carrying amount as if the standard had been applied since the commencement date, but \\r\\ndiscounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n26 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease liabilities as at 1 January 2019 are reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of 31 December 2018 as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating lease commitments disclosed as at 31 December 2018   36 656 \\r\\n\\r\\nWeighted average incremental borrowing rate as at 1 January 2019 2,45% \\r\\n\\r\\nDiscounted operating lease commitments at 1 January 2019 31 847 \\r\\n\\r\\nLess \\r\\n\\r\\nCommitments relating short-term leases  158 \\r\\n\\r\\nAdd \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustment as a result of a different treatment of extension and termination options 1 518 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal lease liability recognized as at 1 January 2019 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nOf which are:  \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent lease liabilities  4 201 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-current lease liabilities  29 006 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe associated right-of-use assets for property leases were measured on a retrospective basis as if the new rules had always been \\r\\napplied. Other right-of use assets were measured at the amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid \\r\\nor accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe recognised right-of-use assets relate to the following types of assets (TEUR):  \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR 31 December 2018  1 January 2019 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nProperties 0 30 529 42 178 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther assets 0 164 87 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal right-of-use assets 0 30 693 42 265 \\r\\n\\r\\nProperty, plant and equipment 16 383 16 383 15 791 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Property, plant and equipment  16 383 47 076   58 056  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe change in accounting policy affected the following items in the balance sheet on 1 January 2019 (TEUR): \\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 property, plant and equipment – increase by 30 257 TEUR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\uf0b7 lease liabilities – increase by 33 207 TEUR \\r\\n\\r\\nThe net impact on retained earnings on 1 January 2019 was a decrease of 2 584 TEUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognised rent expense from short-term leases, leases of low-value assets and variable lease payments of totally 740 \\r\\nthousand Euros for the 6 months ended 30 June 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nPractical expedients applied \\r\\n\\r\\nIn applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics; \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n27 \\r\\n\\r\\nthe accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 January 2019 as short-term \\r\\nleases; \\r\\n\\r\\nexcluding initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset, and  \\r\\n\\r\\nusing hindsight, eg in determining the lease term where the contract includes extension or termination options. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s leasing activities and how these are accounted for \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group leases various offices and other assets (IT equipment and cars). Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 4 \\r\\nto15 years but may have extension options as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide \\r\\nrange of different terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 2018 financial year, leases of property, IT equipment and cars were classified as either finance or operating leases. Payments \\r\\nmade under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) were charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis \\r\\nover the period of the lease.   \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 January 2019, leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset \\r\\nis available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged \\r\\nto profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for \\r\\neach period.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees\\r\\n\\r\\n(d) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option,and\\r\\n\\r\\n(e) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee’s \\r\\nincremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset \\r\\nof similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo determine incremental borrowing rate we have considered: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. existing borrowings (own funding cost) that need to be adjusted for amount, security, term etc. and\\r\\n2. property yield that need to be adjusted for term, amount, quality of property, potential weighted average cost of capital \\r\\n\\r\\n(WACC) element in yields etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor property leases the Bank has decided the usage of the Bank’s own funding cost as a discount rate. For other assets the Bank uses \\r\\nthe interest rate implicit in the lease as discount rate, as it is readily determinable. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the Bank measured the lease liability by: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications (like changes in lease term, in the assessment\\r\\nof an option to purchase the underlying asset, in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, in future \\r\\nlease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, including for example a change to\\r\\nreflect changes in market rental rates following a market rent review and in floating interest rates, or to reflect revised in-substance \\r\\nfixed lease payments (payments are structured as variable lease payments, but there is no genuine variability in those payments and\\r\\nthose payments contain variable clauses that do not have real economic substance).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n28 \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost of the right-of-use asset comprises: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that\\r\\ndate;\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received;\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and\\r\\n\\r\\n(d) an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it\\r\\nis located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are\\r\\nincurred to produce inventories. The lessee incurs the obligation for those costs either at the commencement date or as a \\r\\nconsequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses; and\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications, or to \\r\\nreflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in \\r\\nprofit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment and small \\r\\nitems of office furniture below 5 000 EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These terms are \\r\\nused to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. The majority of extension and termination options held are \\r\\nexercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn determining the lease term, the management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise \\r\\nan extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included \\r\\nin the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated) and based on the assessment performed, the \\r\\npotential impact is immaterial. \\r\\n\\r\\nMOVEMENTS OF THE GROUP'S RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES  \\r\\n\\r\\nSet out below, are the carrying amounts of the Group’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and the movements during the period: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR  1 January 2019 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nRight-of-use assets 30 693 42 265 \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liability 31 847 44 961  \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in total right-of use assets and lease liability is primarily caused by prolonging one existing lease contract, without increasing \\r\\nor decreasing the scope of the lease. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n29 \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, and the \\r\\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are \\r\\nbased on management’s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable \\r\\nunder the circumstances. Management also makes certain judgements, apart from those involving estimations, in the process of \\r\\napplying the accounting policies. Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated \\r\\nfinancial statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the \\r\\nnext financial year include: \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognizes the credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The Standard applies a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) \\r\\napproach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held \\r\\nat FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The assets to test for impairment are divided into three \\r\\ngroups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes assets where there has been no significant increase in credit \\r\\nrisk since initial recognition. In stage 1, the allowances equal the 12-month expected credit loss. Stage 2 includes assets where there \\r\\nhas been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets. In stage 2 and 3, the allowances equal the lifetime \\r\\nexpected credit losses. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for additional category - purchased \\r\\nor originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) - regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of variable \\r\\ninputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include \\r\\n(no major changes comparing to the model applied in calculating the year-end balances) : \\r\\n\\r\\nevaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2; \\r\\n\\r\\nidentification of unlikely to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3; \\r\\n\\r\\nassessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including the \\r\\nvarious formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\r\\nthe modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) \\r\\nand exposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\r\\ndetermining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model; \\r\\n\\r\\nestimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic and \\r\\npessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;  \\r\\n\\r\\nestimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and assigning \\r\\nprobabilities to those scenarios; \\r\\n\\r\\n setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlease refer to Note 12. \\r\\n\\r\\n3.

The swaps are being used to \\r\\nhedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of its fixed rate senior unsecured bonds. Trade date for EUR 200 million and EUR 150 \\r\\nmillion interest swap agreements is 10 October 2018, effective date is 18 October 2018 and maturity date is 18 October 2021. For \\r\\nEUR 300 million interest swap agreement trade date is 11 June 2019, effective date is 21 June 2019 and maturity date 21 October \\r\\n2022. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instruments as the terms of the interest rate swaps \\r\\nmatch the terms of the fixed rate loan (i.e. notional amount maturity payment and reset dates). The Group has established a hedge \\r\\nratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships, as the underlying risk of the interest rate swaps is identical to the hedged risk component. \\r\\nTo test hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the \\r\\nhedging instrument against the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nHedge ineffectiveness can theoretically arise from: \\r\\n\\r\\nA different interest rate curve applied to discount the hedged item and hedging instrument \\r\\n\\r\\nDifferences in the timing of cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument, also a different day count \\r\\n\\r\\nThe counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instrument and hedged \\r\\nitem. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n35 \\r\\n\\r\\n30.06.2019 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 650 000 5 921 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial during first half year 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 350 000 1 128 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial during 2018.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where \\r\\nthe fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from active \\r\\nmarkets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The inputs to \\r\\nthese models are derived from observable market data where possible, but where observable market data is not available, judgment \\r\\nis required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements mentioned techniques were not used extensively \\r\\nas no such financial assets and financial liabilities exist on the statement of financial position of the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n40 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of loans to customers, customer deposits, amounts due from credit institutions and amounts due to credit institutions \\r\\nand other financial assets and liabilities’ obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the rates \\r\\ncurrently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn assessing the fair value for financial assets, the management has performed a discounted cash flow analysis; up-to-date market \\r\\ninformation at the assessment moment is being used for assessing cash flows. For loans where base interest rates are pegged to \\r\\nfloating market interest rates, the Group has considered the difference between the average interest margin of issued loans and the \\r\\naverage interest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has been changed (increased) \\r\\nsince issuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal to the fair value. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of financial liabilities at amortized cost such as Loans and deposits from credit institutions and Deposits from customers, \\r\\nwhich are not on demand, have been estimated based on the discounted cash flow model using interest rates for similar products as \\r\\nat year end. The fair value of those financial liabilities that are on demand or have a floating interest rate has been estimated to be \\r\\napproximately equal to it’s carrying amount. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTIZED COST \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR \\r\\nCarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n30.06.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value  \\r\\n\\r\\n30.06.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value  \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortized cost \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and Balances with Central banks 2 485 346   2 485 346   3 293 090   3 293 090   \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 150 727 150 727 185 346 185 346 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 10 979 181 10 990 807 11 472 138 11 484 286 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 13 615 254 13 615 254 14 950 574 14 962 722 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\n\\r\\ninstitutions  \\r\\n1 945 912 1 929 640 3 939 396 3 906 454 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 9 374 812 9 404 300 9 069 885 9 098 414 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 651 204 651 204 351 235 351 235 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 259 401   259 401   27 914  27 914  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 12 231 329 12 231 329 13 388 430 13 384 017 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarizes the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. Financial \\r\\ninstruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value: \\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or \\r\\nindirectly observable. \\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input is significant to the fair value measurement is \\r\\nunobservable. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of all Group’s contracted derivatives is defined as level 2. These are interest rate swaps and other derivatives and in all \\r\\ncases pricing is based on market observable inputs. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no movements of financial instruments between the levels during 01.01-30.06.2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n41 \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 30 June 2019 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using  \\r\\n\\r\\n(T EUR)  \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in active \\r\\n\\r\\nmarkets (Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\n\\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\n\\r\\nunobservable inputs \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 3) \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and Balances with Central banks 2 485 346   0 0 2 485 346   \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 112 121 38 606 0 150 727 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 10 979 181 10 979 181 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 5 834 0 0 5 834 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\n\\r\\nprofit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 3 842 0 3 842 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 116 604 42 717 0 159 321 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 53 318 0 53 318 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\n\\r\\nother comprehensive income \\r\\n\\r\\nEquity instruments 0 0 9 826 9 826 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 1 877 0 0 1 877 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  2 721 782 138 483 10 989 007 13 849 272 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are \\r\\n\\r\\ndisclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions 26 067 1 919 845 0 1 945 912 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 7 128 047 2 246 765 9 374 812 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 651 204 0 651 204 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 0 0 259 401 259 401 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 50 968 0 50 968 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  26 067 9 750 064 2 506 166 12 282 297 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n42 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement of financial instruments as at 31 December 2018 was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value measurement using  \\r\\n\\r\\n(T EUR)  \\r\\n\\r\\nQuoted prices in active \\r\\n\\r\\nmarkets (Level 1) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant \\r\\n\\r\\nobservable inputs  \\r\\n\\r\\n(Level 2) \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant unobservable \\r\\n\\r\\ninputs (Level 3) \\r\\nTotal \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets for which fair values are disclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and Balances with Central banks 3 293 090   0 0 3 293 090   \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 145 451 39 899 0 185 346 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 0 0 11 484 286 11 484 286 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets held for trading \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 0 1 006 0 1 006 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\n\\r\\nprofit or loss \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 83 192 60 566 0 143 758 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 46 664 0 46 664 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through \\r\\n\\r\\nother comprehensive income \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities 1 265 0 0 1 265 \\r\\n\\r\\nShares 0 0 7 607 7 607 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  3 522 998 148 135 11 491 893 15 163 022 \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities for which fair values are \\r\\n\\r\\ndisclosed \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\n\\r\\ninstitutions \\r\\n22 152 3 917 244 0   3 939 396   \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 0 7 136 994 1 932 891 9 069 885 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 0 351 235 0 351 235 \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments 0 42 457 0 42 457 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal  22 152 11 447 930 1 932 891 13 402 973 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and cash balances with central banks – very liquid and short-term, so the fair value equals to their carrying amount as the \\r\\n\\r\\nassets can be realized at same price in an orderly transaction \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions – very liquid and short-term, so the fair value equals to their carrying amount as the assets \\r\\n\\r\\ncan be realized at same price in an orderly transaction \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 June 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n43 \\r\\n\\r\\nDerivative financial instruments - fair value for this kind of instruments is calculated using discounted cash flow method through \\r\\n\\r\\nwhich net present value (NPV) is obtained. Independently sourced market parameters – mainly zero coupon yield curves with \\r\\n\\r\\ndifferent characteristics – are used to get discount factors.  To some derivatives hedge accounting rules are applicable.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss (Pension Funds) - The value date method is used in the acquisition of pension \\r\\n\\r\\nfund units managed by Luminor Pensions Estonia AS and they are initially recognised at acquisition cost, which is the fair value \\r\\n\\r\\npaid for them. Investments into pension fund units have quoted prices from the market, however the market is inactive and \\r\\n\\r\\ntherefore these are classified as level 2 investments. Information about the NAV of pension funds is made publicly available by \\r\\n\\r\\nthe funds on a daily basis; investments of the managed funds subject for NAV accounting are all categorized as Level 1 \\r\\n\\r\\nInstruments. \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers – Fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows using the market interest rates \\r\\n\\r\\nprevailing at each year-end. Loans are issued on market conditions; For loans, where base interest rates are pegged to floating \\r\\n\\r\\nmarket interest rates, the Group has considered difference between average interest margin of issued loans and average \\r\\n\\r\\ninterest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has been changed (increased) since \\r\\n\\r\\nissuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal to fair value. \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions- pricing is under market conditions; fair value of deposits do not differ from the \\r\\n\\r\\ncarrying value.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers- pricing of the deposits is under market conditions, the fair value of deposits has been determined \\r\\n\\r\\nusing the future cashflows, fair value of deposits do not differ from the carrying value. \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued - initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortized costs. \\r\\n\\r\\nBonds are listed but liquidity and market conditions don’t allow using market price as reliable input. Management has \\r\\n\\r\\ndetermined the fair value by discounting the future cash flows, using the market interest yield curve. Additional info in  Note 8 \\r\\n\\r\\nwhere impact from hedge accounting is explained. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income - The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nmeasurement of shares on level 3 (Visa Inc. and Swift shares) are as follows: conversion rate, trading price, liquidity discount. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe management believes that reasonably possible changes to other unobservable inputs would not result in a significant \\r\\n\\r\\nchange in the estimated fair value. Change in fair value of level 3 instruments between 31.12.2018 and 30.06.2019 is due to \\r\\n\\r\\nrevaluation. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value measurement for liabilities is based on the calculation using non observable inputs thus the same categorization as for \\r\\n\\r\\nassets should be applied. \\r\\n\\r\\n20.

SEGMENT REPORTING\\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as Group Executive Management. The Group \\r\\nExecutive Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about \\r\\nresource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit before tax and is measured \\r\\nconsistently with profit before tax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of expenses after internal \\r\\nfunds transfer pricing, as management primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a performance measure. \\r\\nFees & commission income for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made between different product \\r\\ncategories for segment reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments (including \\r\\ninternal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Unallocated segment) and income and expenses not booked \\r\\non customer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using internally agreed allocation keys. Only assets and \\r\\nliabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating segments are reported under the respective segments, all other balance \\r\\nsheet items are reported under Unallocated segment. \\r\\n\\r\\nStarting from 2019, new operating model got implemented in Luminor Group and CODM started monitoring operating segments on \\r\\nthe new basis (as described above). Comparative information was aligned in order to be in compliance with new segmentation \\r\\nprinciples. \\r\\n\\r\\nOPERATING SEGMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth Management. \\r\\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. \\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate Banking segment services business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager. Retail Banking segment services \\r\\nbusiness customers without a dedicated relationship manager and private individuals not belonging to Wealth Management segment. \\r\\nWealth Management services wealthy private individuals and holding companies associated with those individuals. Results of other \\r\\noperating segments below the quantitative thresholds set in IFRS 8 which are not allocated to main business segments are included \\r\\nin Unallocated segment.

The transaction, worth 1 billion euros, represents one of the largest \\r\\ninvestments in the Baltic history. \\r\\n\\r\\nNordea Bank Abp and DNB Bank ASA each retain a 20% equity stake in Luminor and will continue to support the bank with long-\\r\\nterm funding, expertise and on-going representation on the Supervisory Council. Blackstone has agreed with Nordea Bank Abp that \\r\\nit will purchase Nordea Bank Abp’s remaining 20% stake over the coming years. \\r\\n\\r\\nBlackstone is one of the world’s leading investment firms and is an ideal partner for Luminor as we undertake one of the most \\r\\nextensive corporate transformations in the Baltics. Blackstone’s proven track record in transformations, strong financial standing \\r\\nand network of global talent will support Luminor as it grows as the largest local independent bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter, Luminor continued to implement the new operating model to become a more efficient, more resilient and \\r\\nmore resolvable organisation. We also progressed further with the separation from the payment infrastructure and information \\r\\nsystems of the parent banks. We finalised the first phase of migration in Latvia and Lithuania, resulting in the successful transfer of \\r\\nnearly 24% of our active legacy Nordea customers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to multiple pan-Baltic sales campaigns and improving management of sales channels, the Retail Banking team succeeded in \\r\\nsustaining lending sales volumes and growing the deposit portfolio. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, the Corporate Banking team also succeeded in growing deposit portfolio and continued to focus on increasing the \\r\\nprofitability of our corporate lending portfolio by reducing the portfolio of non-performing loans and transferring services for micro \\r\\nenterprises to the retail banking.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the deposit portfolio grew by 16.7% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pension assets under management in the Baltics reached 1.39 billion euros in the third quarter of 2019, which was 13% more \\r\\nthan in the same quarter of last year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe continue our efforts in averting money laundering and terrorist financing through the prevention, detection, and reporting of \\r\\nunusual activities. At Luminor we are continuously investing in our systems, internal training and awareness raising activities in this \\r\\narea, and we are improving our processes for combating financial crime in a constantly changing environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltics continue to benefit from a strong macroeconomic climate and a stable operating environment, and the region is among \\r\\nthe most economically dynamic in the European Union. Luminor is on track with its transformation and financial plans to grow as a \\r\\nbank dedicated to supporting the sustainable growth of the Baltic region by providing long-term commitment to businesses and \\r\\nindividuals. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\n\\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 4  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nOverview \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (“Luminor”) was established on 1 October 2017 by the merger of the operations in the Baltic states of DNB Bank \\r\\nASA (Commercial Register no. 984 851 006) and Nordea Bank AB (currently Nordea Bank Abp, as Nordea has been domiciled in \\r\\nFinland since 1 October 2018 following the cross-border reversed merger between Nordea Bank AB (publ) and Nordea Bank Abp, \\r\\nregistration no. 2858394-9) to create a new-generation financial service provider for local businesses and financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 it was announced that the transaction signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB Bank ASA and Nordea \\r\\nBank AB and the US-based private equity firm Blackstone had been closed, and as a result a consortium led by private equity funds \\r\\nmanaged by Blackstone acquired a 60% majority stake in the bank. The bank’s initial owners Nordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB \\r\\nBank ASA (\"DNB\") each retained a 20% equity stake in Luminor, but an agreement has been signed by Blackstone and Nordea for \\r\\npurchase of Nordea’s 20% stake over the coming years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with approximately 1 million clients, 2500 employees, and \\r\\nmarket share of 16.8% in deposits and 19.5% in lending as at the end of the third quarter of 2019. Total shareholders’ equity \\r\\namounts to EUR 1.6 billion and Luminor is capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 18.7%. Luminor’s vision is to become the best financial \\r\\necosystem for its customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers a wide range of products and services to its customers through all possible channels, digital and physical, with 36 \\r\\ncustomer service centres, including four meet-up points, in total in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Luminor owns 319 ATMs \\r\\nthroughout the Baltic states, and additionally provides services through 100 ATMs in partnership with other financial services \\r\\nproviders. \\r\\n\\r\\n30 September 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Estonia Latvia Lithuania GroupGr Total  \\r\\n\\r\\nNo of customers ~136 000 ~235 000 ~584 000 ~955 000 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket shares      \\r\\n\\r\\nLending 14.3% 24.4% 21.1% 19.5% \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits 10.7% 17.3% 21.5% 16.8% \\r\\n\\r\\nNo of client service \\r\\ncenters, including \\r\\nmeet- up points \\r\\n\\r\\n8 11 17 36  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of third quarter Luminor had 25 subsidiaries in the Baltics: Luminor Asset Management IPAS (Latvia), Luminor Latvijas \\r\\natklātais pensiju fonds AS (Latvia), UAB Luminor Investiciju valdymas (Lithuania), and Luminor Pensions Estonia AS (Estonia) manage \\r\\npension assets; Recurso UAB (Lithuania), Promano Lit UAB (Lithuania), Industrius UAB (Lithuania), Gėlužės projektai UAB (Latvia), \\r\\nIntractus UAB (Lithuania), Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ (Estonia), Promano Estonia OÜ (Estonia), Luminor Finance SIA (Latvia), Realm SIA \\r\\n(Latvia), Trioleta SIA (Latvia), Baltic ipasums SIA (Latvia), Promano Lat SIA (Latvia),  Salvus SIA (Latvia), Salvus 2 SIA (Latvia), Salvus 3 \\r\\nSIA (Latvia), Salvus 4 SIA (Latvia), and Salvus 6 SIA (Latvia) are asset management companies; Luminor Liising AS (Estonia), Luminor \\r\\nLīzings SIA (Latvia), Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA (Latvia), and Luminor Lizingas UAB (Lithuania) provide leasing services.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 July 2019, Luminor sold its subsidiary property holding company SIA Skanstes 12 (Latvia) to the investment company Colonna.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 September 2019 Ilja Sovetov was appointed as a member of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS by the Supervisory \\r\\nCouncil of Luminor Bank AS. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 September 2019 Luminor Kindlustusmaakler OÜ was merged with Luminor Liising AS.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019, the Shareholders’ Meeting of Luminor Bank AS appointed Nadim El Gabbani, Johan Lilliehöök and Jerome \\r\\nMourgue D\\'Algue as new members of the bank’s Supervisory Council, effective the same day. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 5  \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview  \\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal trade and rising trade barriers are the predominant risks this year, causing heightened financial and economic volatility. Global \\r\\nmanufacturing clearly remains in the epicentre of an economic slowdown, while the consumer is holding strong. Services continue to \\r\\noutperform manufacturing as there has still been only limited spillover from the weakness in manufacturing to the more strongly \\r\\nperforming services sector, which benefits from growth led by domestic demand. The consumer is still showing no signs of retreat in \\r\\nadvanced countries including the Baltic states, and labour markets there actually continue to be tight, though there are early signs of \\r\\nmoderation ahead. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic states, along with Ireland and some CEEC peers like Poland, are today one of the most dynamic economic areas of the EU. \\r\\nThe average growth rate for 2017-18 exceeded 5% in Estonia, with robust yearly growth of 4.7% in Latvia and a bold expansion of \\r\\n3.8% over the year in Lithuania. During the four quarters from the third quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019, GDP growth \\r\\naveraged 1.4% over the year in the euro area at the same time that broad-based, though slowing, yearly growth reached 4.6%  in \\r\\nEstonia, 4.1% in Latvia and 3.7% in Lithuania.   \\r\\n\\r\\nFaced with the external headwinds, growth has started to moderate gradually, albeit from a high level, while labour markets still \\r\\nremain firm and tight as European economies pass through the current soft patch in the global trade cycle. The key export markets \\r\\nfor the Baltics continue on a path of moderate growth, as the euro area, the key destination for Baltic exports, is benefiting from \\r\\ntighter labour markets and support from domestic demand, including new stimulus packages. Euro-area growth is expected to pick \\r\\nup marginally in the years ahead from the current ca 1.2%  over the year pace as the global growth environment and global trade is \\r\\nexpected to gradually recover.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEuro area GDP decelerated noticeably last autumn to only 1.2% year on year and 0.3% over the quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018, \\r\\nwith industry and trade making a softer contribution. Growth remained at 1.2% over the year in the second quarter of 2019, with the \\r\\neconomies that are more open to global trade, including Germany, seeing growth rates fall. Against this external backdrop of \\r\\nweakening growth the Baltic countries have so far largely managed to resist disruptions to trade, and they sustained softer but still \\r\\nquite broadly based economic momentum in the second quarter, benefiting most notably from investment, consumption and \\r\\nhealthy residential construction. Growth over the year in the second quarter was 3.8% in Estonia, 2.9% in Latvia and 3.9% in \\r\\nLithuania, and it remained on a gently moderating path. The balance of risks remains tilted to the downside with risks of a spillover \\r\\nfrom external markets bringing softness to industry and export orders. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe shift from de-synchronised growth to a synchronised moderation of growth is proceeding as expected, and the key risks for the \\r\\nopen Baltic economies emanate from the trade frictions that are hitting advanced countries. A slowdown in global trade remains the \\r\\nroot cause of the weaker outlook for growth and the emerging downside risks for the euro area including the Baltic economies.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe expect the moderation of growth to be only gradual given the continued support from strong labour markets and healthy \\r\\ndomestic demand, which remain the key engines of growth.   \\r\\n\\r\\nActivities \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor completed its cross-border merger on 2 January 2019 and continues its operations in all the three Baltic states through the \\r\\nbank headquartered in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the merger, all the assets, rights and \\r\\nliabilities of Luminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) were transferred to Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank \\r\\ncontinues its activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established branches. A new organisational set up and a new \\r\\ngovernance structure were also introduced, and new members of the management bodies were appointed. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the cross-border merger, the deposits and holdings in financial instruments of the customers of Luminor Bank AS \\r\\nLatvian branch and Luminor Bank AS Lithuanian branch are guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and investor protection scheme \\r\\nestablished and operated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to roll out the new operating model during the third quarter by simplifying its structure and decision-making \\r\\nprocess, unifying and executing IT consolidation, strengthening its controls, and becoming more efficient, more resilient and more \\r\\nresolvable. These developments meant the Luminor team was reduced by 69 employees during the third quarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter, Luminor continued to cut itself free from the payment infrastructure and information systems of its parent \\r\\nbanks. In July Luminor became independent of SEPA payment flows from the Nordea systems, by routing the payments through the \\r\\nLuminor payment hub that had been established during the reporting period. The first phase of migrating the legacy Nordea \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 6  \\r\\n\\r\\ncustomer base to the Luminor information systems was finalised in Latvia and Lithuania, resulting in the successful transfer of some \\r\\n24% of active customers. The bank has finished separating its leasing, factoring and pension information systems from the Nordea \\r\\nsystems. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 September Luminor disabled access to Luminor digital channels using code cards, which encouraged Lithuanian and Latvian \\r\\nclients to use other means of authentication. Around 500 thousand code-card users were transferred to other authentication tools. \\r\\nBy the end of September, 50% of Luminor internet bank users in Lithuania and Latvia were using Smart-ID as an authentication tool \\r\\nfor accessing the internet bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter Luminor continued to transfer customer data and services to the unified Luminor system in Latvia and Lithuania. \\r\\nThe process of moving customers to the unified systems is going according to the plan and will be finalised in Latvia, Lithuania and \\r\\nEstonia next year. The digital team continued their efforts in developing the new Luminor digital channels and preparing our current \\r\\nchannels for the process of transferring customer data. The main purpose of this process is to offer similar functionality to those \\r\\ncustomers who are transferred, and to secure smooth and uninterrupted services for them.   \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team continued consolidating distribution channels and improving efficiency in related areas. Six locations in the \\r\\ncustomer service network were closed and two centres were transformed into meet-up points. At the end of the third quarter, \\r\\nLuminor was serving its customers in a total of 36 locations across the Baltics.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cashless concept was introduced in customer service centres across all the Baltic states, and the project was completed in the \\r\\nthird quarter in Estonia. All Luminor’s customer service centres are now cashless and serve customers using alternative tools through \\r\\npayment cards and ATMs.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple Pan-Baltic sales campaigns were launched in consumer and mortgage lending to stabilise new lending volumes following \\r\\nlegislative changes on advertising of loans. Through these campaigns and improved management of sales channels, the retail banking \\r\\nteam has succeeded in sustaining sales volumes in lending and in growing the deposit portfolio compared to the same period last \\r\\nyear. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter of 2019 the Corporate Banking team continued to focus on increasing the profitability of our corporate lending \\r\\nportfolio, reducing the portfolio of non-performing loans,and transferring services for micro enterprises to Retail Banking team. The \\r\\nteam also succeeded in increasing their deposit portfolio during the quarter.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLoan loss provisions increased in the third quarter because of additional provisions in the Estonian non-performing loans book and \\r\\nnew non-performing loans in the Latvian renewable energy sector. The macro environment continues to be very supportive. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main focus in Wealth Management in the third quarter was on growing the business, ensuring high customer satisfaction and \\r\\nexecuting changes in the Pan-Baltic operating model. Collaboration with other business segments supported both growth and \\r\\ncustomer satisfaction.   \\r\\n\\r\\nBy mid-October all the major Management Board level re-appointments had been carried out for pension entities. Approvals had also \\r\\nbeen received from the local financial supervisory authorities. To facilitate an orderly transition, multiple workshops have been held \\r\\nto map functional responsibilities and conflicts of interest, as in the quality and risk analysis (QRA) framework.    \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pension assets under management in the Baltics reached EUR 1.39 billion in the third quarter of 2019, increasing by 13% from \\r\\nthe same quarter of 2018. Luminor had 298 thousand second pillar and 62 thousand third pillar pension customers at the end of the \\r\\nquarter. Total assets under management have grown solidly as financial markets have performed well and the external sales channel \\r\\nfor pension products in Estonia has been successful.  \\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate Banking focused on growing the assets under management and ensuring a high level of customer satisfaction by helping \\r\\naffluent and high net worth individuals and their families to grow, manage and preserve their wealth. During the quarter the Private \\r\\nBanking team also focused on attracting new customers from the market.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 7  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor aims to become the financial partner in the Baltics for the local way of living and doing business. We are dedicated to \\r\\nsupporting sustainable growth in the Baltic region by providing long-term commitment to businesses and individuals, and corporate \\r\\nsocial responsibility is an inseparable part of that. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the third quarter of 2019, Luminor started a comprehensive review of its corporate social responsibility policies, procedures and \\r\\nprinciples with the aim of having a more focused and lasting impact in this area. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to this, efforts were made to promote financial and digital literacy and support entrepreneurship, and this included \\r\\nlectures in Luminor customer service centres, work with state agencies to promote and develop cyber security, and a radio \\r\\nprogramme on financial literacy. \\r\\n\\r\\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORTS  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is continuously committed to preventing and detecting money laundering and financial crime, reviewing regularly its AML \\r\\npractices and investing in necessary human and technological capabilities in this field. Being a subject to different legal requirements, \\r\\nLuminor acts in full transparency and collaboration with all relevant supervisory and regulatory authorities. Luminor has developed \\r\\nwide knowledge of its customers as Luminor primarily serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers with a strong \\r\\npersonal or business connection to the Baltic states.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has developed and implemented a financial crime risk management framework to prevent, detect, manage and report \\r\\npotential financial crime risk. The framework consists of financial crime detection technology, comprehensive policies and procedures, \\r\\nregular risk assessments, training and awareness-raising, and ongoing monitoring of new and developing financial crime risks. In \\r\\naddition, Luminor follows international guidelines, recommendations and standards issued by the regulatory and supervisory \\r\\nauthorities, relevant international bodies, local banking associations and financial intelligence units in each Baltic state. Luminor \\r\\ncontinuously invests in its systems and processes to adapt in a constantly changing environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first three quarters of 2019, more than 100 compliance related training sessions and awareness-raising events were carried \\r\\nout. \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 30 SEPTEMBER 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 October, the Supervisory Council appointed Georg Kaltenbrunner as a member of the bank’s Management Board and the new \\r\\nChief Risk Officer. As of 1 November Georg Kaltenbrunner will take over the position from Hannu Saksala. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 October, Indrek Heinloo and Marilin Pikaro were appointed as members of the Management Board of Luminor Bank AS by the \\r\\nSupervisory Council of Luminor Bank AS effective as of the same day. \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 8  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Results \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s financial results of the third quarter continued to be affected by exceptional and restructuring costs with the focus on \\r\\naccelerating the transformation and building areas of superior customer experience, such as consolidating technological platforms, \\r\\nright-sizing the business, simplifying the product and service portfolio, and increasing efficiency. \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit in the third quarter was EUR 16.9 million, which was EUR 26.3 million lower than in the same quarter of 2018. The loan \\r\\nportfolio declined by 9.2%, while the net interest income-to-loans ratio increased from 2.2% to 2.3% following moves to improve \\r\\nprofitability by ensuring fair and rational pricing of risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses in the third quarter were EUR 71.4 million, which is EUR 17.3 million higher than last year as a result of the \\r\\ntransformation costs incurred and net impairment on loans to customers. Exceptional costs in the third quarter were EUR 22.2 \\r\\nmillion, of which 80% were IT expenses, followed by 12% in other transformation costs, and 8% in staff expenses. Exceptional costs \\r\\nwere EUR 4.1 million higher than in the previous quarter, and EUR 2.3 million of this went on IT expenses for technology \\r\\ndevelopments. Impairment of loans to customers and other assets during the third quarter was EUR 7.3 million, which was EUR 6 \\r\\nmillion less than in the second quarter. This result was mainly affected by a review of several large exposures in the legacy portfolio, \\r\\nwhile the quality of the overall credit portfolio remains good. Moreover, the non-performing loans (“NPL”) ratio has decreased from \\r\\n5.7% to 4.3% over the past 12 months. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of third quarter stood at 108.4%, down from 139.4% a year ago. The decline in the funding gap \\r\\nwas driven by an increase of EUR 1.4 billion in deposits and a decrease of EUR 1.1 billion in loans. \\r\\n\\r\\nKey figures and ratios of Luminor*   \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR \\r\\nQ3 Q2  Q3        January-September Full year \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 2019 2018 2019 2018 2018** \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit 16 887 6 711 43 146 49 965 120 114 124 949 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity 1 624 589 1 718 147 1 766 439 1 716 511 1 751 695 1 757 148 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE), % 4.1 1.6 9.7 3.9 9.2 7.1 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets 13 905 118 14 081 334 14 637 665 14 549 574 14 905 355 15 201 023 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA), % 0.5 0.2 1.2 0.5 1.1 0.8 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 62 104 63 280 66 034 189 198 194 134 259 733 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets 13 579 747 13 723 711 14 245 136 14 230 763 14 514 836 14 844 146 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM), % 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio (C/I), % 73.5 76.0 56.1 75.9 59.1 62.3 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio, %*** 0.33 0.37 -0.16 0.15 -0.14 -0.06 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 10 760 156 10 979 181 11 853 592 10 760 156 11 853 592 11 472 138 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 9 923 439 9 374 812 8 505 854 9 923 439 8 505 854 9 069 885 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio, % 108.4 117.1 139.4 108.4 139.4 126.4 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET1 ratio, % 18.7 18.0 17.3 18.7 17.3 18.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio (gross), % 4.3 4.3 5.7 4.3 5.7 5.3 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income / Loans, % 2.3 2.3 2.2 2.4 2.2 2.3 \\r\\n\\r\\n* Quarterly ratios and Jan-Sep 2019 ratios (ROE, ROA, NIM, C/I, Credit impairment ratio) are expressed on an annualised basis \\r\\n\\r\\n**Luminor Group AB full year consolidated figures     \\r\\n\\r\\n***If loan recoveries prevail, the ratio is negative \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 9  \\r\\n\\r\\nExplanations  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity (belonging to the owners of the company) = (equity at the end of the reporting period + equity at the end of the previous period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) = Net profit / Average equity * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets = (assets at the end of the reporting period + assets at the end of the previous period) / 2  \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) = Net profit / Average assets * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets = (interest-earning assets at the end of the reporting period + interest-earning assets at the end of the previous period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) = Net interest income / Average interest earning assets * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio = Total operating expenses / Net total operating income * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio = Net losses or reversal on loans to customers / Net loans, average * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio = Loans to customers / Deposits from customers * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio = Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-weighted Assets \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio = Gross impaired loans (Stage 3 loans) / Gross loans * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nLENDING AND DEPOSITS  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lending portfolio continued to shrink and at the end of third quarter it totalled EUR 10.8 billion.

Deposits from customers are the main source of funding \\r\\nfor Luminor and made up EUR 9.9 billion or 72.0% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity at the end of the third quarter of 2019, \\r\\nhaving been EUR 9.3 billion or 66.9% at the end of the second quarter. The funding base is predominantly EUR-denominated. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to deposits, Luminor also has outstanding debt securities and funding from parent banks  (i.e. funding from DNB Bank \\r\\nASA and Nordea Bank Abp) that together constitute a substantial part of the funding base. At the end of the third quarter of 2019 \\r\\nthe value of the bonds outstanding under the EMTN programme totalled EUR 658 million, with the transaction of 11 June 2019 \\r\\nbuilding on the inaugural transaction of EUR 350 million from October 2018. The Senior Unsecured Medium-Term Note Program \\r\\nhas been assigned a rating of Baa2 by Moody’s. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2019, funding from parents amounted to EUR 1,260 million and was provided by DNB Bank ASA and \\r\\nNordea Bank Abp in the form of a syndicate, where each syndicate partner provides 50%. Long-term funding is committed for six \\r\\nyears (4+2) starting from 1 October 2017, when Luminor was established. Short-term funding is in the form of revolving credit of 364 \\r\\ndays. In addition to the outstanding funding already utilised, there is also a committed unused credit line of EUR 2,944 million in \\r\\nplace.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the changes in the ownership of Luminor, a new facility agreement has come into force from the fourth quarter of 2019. \\r\\nThe total amount committed to the facility under the new agreement (used and un-used combined) initially had a total commitment \\r\\nof EUR 4,204 million, but which was reducted to EUR 2,837 million at closing of the Blackstone transaction. The facility amount is \\r\\ncommitted for five years from 1 October 2019 and it can be drawn with maturities of one, two or three years. In addition, the new \\r\\nfacility is partly secured, as Luminor has assigned a total of EUR 1,995 million of mortgage loans as collateral to the new facility. The \\r\\npledge on the mortgage loans is applicable from 25 September 2019. The reduction in the overall limit of the new facility agreement \\r\\nwith DNB and Nordea means that the total committed, but unused, credit line declined to EUR 1,577 million from the fourth quarter \\r\\nof 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of Baa1/Prime-2, \\r\\nwith a stable outlook. There have been no changes to Luminor’s ratings since then. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 15  \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor uses different metrics to measure liquidity risk. One metric used is the LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio). The LCR for Luminor \\r\\nwas 144.8% as at the end of the third quarter by the CRR LCR definition. The liquidity buffer is composed of highly liquid central \\r\\nbank eligible securities and cash. Long-term liquidity risk is measured as the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). As at the end of third \\r\\nquarter of 2019, Luminor’s NSFR was 118.0%. NSFR decreased by 9.4% versus quarter two (Q2 2019: 127.4%) due to mortgages \\r\\npledged for parent funding (see funding section for more information). \\r\\n\\r\\n(percentage) Q3  2019 Q2 2019 Q1 2019 Q4 2018* Q3  2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 144.8% 132.5% 131.2% 189% 130.4% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR 118.0% 127.4% 122.0% 114.0% 106.4% \\r\\n\\r\\n* Luminor Group AB consolidated figures \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are predominantly from residents of the Baltics. In total, 99.1% of all deposits from households and non-\\r\\nfinancial corporations are from EU residents. \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits split by residency per country: \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n       Total                   Estonia                      Latvia             Lithuania \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nCAPITAL \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continues to have strong capitalisation that is sufficient to ensure the financial stability and supply the capital needed to \\r\\ndeliver the business strategy. The Total Capital Ratio of Luminor was 18.7% as at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which is \\r\\ncomfortably above the internal target of 17.0%. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Total Capital Ratio is fully covered by Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Luminor uses the Standardised method in the Capital \\r\\nAdequacy calculations to calculate credit and market risk. Operational risk is calculated using the Basic Indicator Approach method.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2019, the Leverage Ratio, calculated using CRR, was 10.9%, compared to 10.6% at the end of the \\r\\nsecond quarter of 2019. The Leverage Ratio is calculated as the bank’s total Tier 1 own funds divided by its total risk exposure \\r\\nmeasure, including the risk positions on assets and off balance sheet liabilities. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n1.2%\\r\\n\\r\\n96.8%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.0% 1.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.0%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.5% 0.5%\\r\\n\\r\\n96.9%\\r\\n\\r\\n2.6%0.9%\\r\\n\\r\\n97.2%\\r\\n\\r\\n1.9%\\r\\n\\r\\nBaltic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOther EU Non-EU \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 16  \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital ratios  \\r\\n\\r\\nPosition  Q3 2019 Q2 2019 Q1 2019 Q4 2018* Q3 2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nCapital adequacy 18.73% 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% \\r\\n\\r\\nLeverage Ratio 10.89% 10.59% 12.00% 10.38% 10.68% \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 Ratio 18.73% 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% \\r\\n\\r\\nT1 Capital Ratio 18.73% 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal Capital Ratio 18.73% 17.99% 20.02% 18.04% 17.25% \\r\\n\\r\\n   * Luminor Group AB consolidated figures \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nOwn funds requirements \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR 30 September 2019 31 December 2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nTOTAL RISK EXPOSURE AMOUNT 8 412 881 9 206 164 \\r\\n\\r\\n1.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE INFORMATION \\r\\n\\r\\nNew company Luminor Holding AS established on the 14th of May 2019 is the new parent company of Luminor Bank AS (the Bank or \\r\\nthe Group) since 23 September 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 2019 Luminor Bank AS has completed its cross-border merger and continues its operations in all Baltic countries \\r\\nthrough the Estonian registered bank, Luminor Bank AS, and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30th of September 2019 a consortium led by private equity funds managed by Blackstone acquired a 60% majority stake in the \\r\\nLuminor Holding AS, the owner of Luminor Bank AS. Luminor Bank AS current owners, Nordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB BANK \\r\\nASA (\"DNB\"), will each retain a 20% equity stake in the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 September 2019 Luminor Bank AS directly or indirectly owned majority in the following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Estonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country  \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Latvia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Lithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Liising AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Pensions Estonia AS \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Est OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n Uus-Sadama 11 OÜ (under \\r\\nliquidation)  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Asset Management IPAS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Finance SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Līzings SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Realm SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 2 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 3 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 4 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 6 SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n Trioleta SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Baltic ipasums SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Industrius UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Intractus UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Lit UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Recurso UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Investiciju \\r\\nValdymas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Lizingas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Gėlužės projektai UAB \\r\\n(under liquidation) \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 30 September 2019 Luminor Bank AS had ownership in the following associated companies (25%): \\r\\n\\r\\n ALD Automotive AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n SIA ALD Automotive \\r\\n\\r\\n UAB ALD Automotive  \\r\\n\\r\\n SIA Kredītinformācijas Birojs \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (the Bank or the Group) was prepared in accordance \\r\\nwith IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed consolidated interim financial \\r\\ninformation does not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in \\r\\nconjunction with the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year ended 31 December 2018. As described in the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 25  \\r\\n\\r\\nsection Accounting for the merger below, following the merger on 2 January 2019, the condensed consolidated interim financial \\r\\ninformation includes the financial information for 3 merged banks, therefore for the purpose of obtaining annual financial \\r\\ninformation for the same group of entities, we advise the reader to also refer to the consolidated annual financial statements for \\r\\nthe year ended 31 December 2018 of Luminor Bank AS’s parent entity, Luminor Group AB (holding), available at \\r\\nhttps://www.luminor.ee/en/financial-reports. Those consolidated financial statements represent substantially the financial position \\r\\nand results of the 3 merged banks, with certain minor additional balances and transactions from Luminor Group AB (holding) entity. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are consistent with \\r\\nthose followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, \\r\\nexcept for the additional policy for accounting for the merger, and adoption of new and amended standards as set out below. \\r\\n\\r\\nACCOUNTING FOR THE MERGER \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS does not prescribe the method of accounting for transactions under common control. Pursuant to IAS 8, management has \\r\\ndetermined that the merger is accounted for using the predecessor method of accounting. Under this method the financial \\r\\nstatements are presented as if the businesses had been combined from the beginning of the earliest period presented (or the date \\r\\nthat the entities were brought under common control, if later). The assets and liabilities of the banks transferred under common \\r\\ncontrol are recognised at their predecessor values, i.e at their carrying values from the financial statements at the highest level of \\r\\nconsolidation (i.e. Luminor Group AB (holding)). No new goodwill arises under predecessor method. Any difference between the \\r\\nconsideration given and the aggregate book value of the assets and liabilities (as of the date of the transaction) of the acquired \\r\\nentity is included in equity. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the completion of the merger on 2 January 2019, all assets and liabilities of Luminor Bank AS, Luminor Bank Latvia and \\r\\nLuminor Bank Lithuania have been combined with the retrosepective effect. Therefore, 2018 comparatives in this condensed \\r\\nconsolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS include also the financial results of the Luminor Bank Latvia and \\r\\nLuminor Bank Lithuania in accordance with the policy described above.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThis note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on the Group’s financial statements and discloses the new \\r\\naccounting policies that have been applied from 1 January 2019 below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 “Leases” was issued on 13 January 2016 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The new \\r\\nstandard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. All leases result in the \\r\\nlessee obtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and, if lease payments are made over time, also obtaining \\r\\nfinancing. Accordingly, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases as was required by \\r\\nIAS 17 and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Lessees are required to recognize: (a) assets and liabilities for all \\r\\nleases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value; and (b) using depreciation of lease assets \\r\\nseparately from interest on lease liabilities in the income statement. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting \\r\\nrequirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases and account for \\r\\nthose two types of leases differently. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of \\r\\n12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option (‘short-term leases’), and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is \\r\\nof low value (‘low-value assets’). \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustments recognised on adoption of IFRS 16 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group decided that it will apply the standard using the modified retrospective method and has not restated comparatives for \\r\\nthe 2018 reporting period. The Group recognized a right of use asset of 30 623 thousand Euro against a corresponding lease liability \\r\\nin the amount of 33 207 thousand Euro and the impact to the equity as of 1 January 2019 amounts to 2 514 thousand Euro, \\r\\ndecreasing its balance. Net impact on equity was caused by the fact that the Group decided to recognise the right-of-use assets at \\r\\nthe date of initial application, measuring them at their carrying amount as if the standard had been applied since the \\r\\ncommencement date, but discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.luminor.ee/en/financial-reports\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 26  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease liabilities as at 1 January 2019 are reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of 31 December 2018 as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR   \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating lease commitments disclosed as at 31 December 2018                                              36 656 \\r\\n\\r\\nWeighted average incremental borrowing rate as at 1 January 2019 2,45% \\r\\n\\r\\nDiscounted operating lease commitments at 1 January 2019 31 847 \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\nLess  \\r\\n\\r\\nCommitments relating short-term leases  158 \\r\\n\\r\\nAdd  \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustment as a result of a different treatment of extension and termination options 1 518 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal lease liability recognized as at 1 January 2019 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nOf which are:       \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent lease liabilities   4 201 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-current lease liabilities   29 006 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nThe associated right-of-use assets for property leases were measured on a retrospective basis as if the new rules had always been \\r\\napplied.

Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 4 \\r\\nto15 years but may have extension options as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a \\r\\nwide range of different terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 2018 financial year, leases of property, IT equipment and cars were classified as either finance or operating leases. \\r\\nPayments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) were charged to profit or loss on a straight-\\r\\nline basis over the period of the lease.   \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 January 2019, leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset \\r\\nis available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged \\r\\nto profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability \\r\\nfor each period.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees \\r\\n\\r\\n(d) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option,and \\r\\n\\r\\n(e) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the \\r\\nlessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to \\r\\nobtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo determine incremental borrowing rate we have considered: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. existing borrowings (own funding cost) that need to be adjusted for amount, security, term etc. and \\r\\n2. property yield that need to be adjusted for term, amount, quality of property, potential weighted average cost of capital \\r\\n\\r\\n(WACC) element in yields etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor property leases the Bank has decided the usage of the Bank’s own funding cost as a discount rate. For other assets the Bank \\r\\nuses the interest rate implicit in the lease as discount rate, as it is readily determinable. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the Bank measured the lease liability by:  \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;  \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 28  \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications (like changes in lease term, in the \\r\\nassessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, \\r\\nin future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, including for example a \\r\\nchange to reflect changes in market rental rates following a market rent review and in floating interest rates, or to reflect revised in-\\r\\nsubstance fixed lease payments (payments are structured as variable lease payments, but there is no genuine variability in those \\r\\npayments and those payments contain variable clauses that do not have real economic substance). \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost of the right-of-use asset comprises: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that \\r\\ndate; \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(d) an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it \\r\\nis located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs \\r\\nare incurred to produce inventories. The lessee incurs the obligation for those costs either at the commencement date or as a \\r\\nconsequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications, or to \\r\\nreflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset\\'s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in \\r\\nprofit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment and \\r\\nsmall items of office furniture below 5 000 EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These terms are \\r\\nused to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. The majority of extension and termination options held are \\r\\nexercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn determining the lease term, the management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise \\r\\nan extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included \\r\\nin the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated) and based on the assessment performed, the \\r\\npotential impact is immaterial. \\r\\n\\r\\nMOVEMENTS OF THE GROUP\\'S RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES  \\r\\n\\r\\nSet out below, are the carrying amounts of the Group’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and the movements during the \\r\\nperiod: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR  1 January 2019 30 September 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nRight-of-use assets 30 693 57 277 \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liability 33 207 58 710 \\r\\n\\r\\nChange in total right-of use assets and lease liability is primarily caused by prolonging one existing lease contract, without     \\r\\nincreasing or decreasing the scope of the lease. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 29  \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements, and the \\r\\ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are \\r\\nbased on management’s experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable \\r\\nunder the circumstances. Management also makes certain judgements, apart from those involving estimations, in the process of \\r\\napplying the accounting policies. Judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated \\r\\nfinancial statements and estimates that can cause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the \\r\\nnext financial year include. \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognizes the credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The Standard applies a forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) \\r\\napproach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans and other debt financial assets not held \\r\\nat FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The assets to test for impairment are divided into three \\r\\ngroups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes assets where there has been no significant increase in \\r\\ncredit risk since initial recognition. In stage 1, the allowances equal the 12-month expected credit loss. Stage 2 includes assets \\r\\nwhere there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets. In stage 2 and 3, the allowances \\r\\nequal the lifetime expected credit losses. Loss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for additional \\r\\ncategory - purchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) - regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an \\r\\ninstrument.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the choice of \\r\\nvariable inputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates \\r\\ninclude (no major changes comparing to the model applied in calculating the year-end balances) : \\r\\n\\r\\n evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2;  \\r\\n\\r\\n identification of unlikely to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3; \\r\\n\\r\\n assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, including the \\r\\nvarious formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\r\\n the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) \\r\\nand exposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\r\\n determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;  \\r\\n\\r\\n estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, optimistic and \\r\\npessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;  \\r\\n\\r\\n estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and assigning \\r\\nprobabilities to those scenarios; \\r\\n\\r\\n setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlease refer to Note 12. \\r\\n\\r\\n3.

The swaps are \\r\\nbeing used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of its fixed rate senior unsecured bonds. Trade date for EUR 200 \\r\\nmillion and EUR 150 million interest swap agreements is 10 October 2018, effective date is 18 October 2018 and maturity date is 18 \\r\\nOctober 2021. For EUR 300 million interest swap agreement trade date is 11 June 2019, effective date is 21 June 2019 and maturity \\r\\ndate 21 October 2022. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instruments as the terms of the interest rate swaps \\r\\nmatch the terms of the fixed rate loan (i.e. notional amount, maturity, payment and reset dates). The Group has established a \\r\\nhedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships, as the underlying risk of the interest rate swaps is identical to the hedged risk \\r\\ncomponent. To test hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair \\r\\nvalue of the hedging instrument against the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nHedge ineffectiveness can theoretically arise from: \\r\\n\\r\\n A different interest rate curve applied to discount the hedged item and hedging instrument \\r\\n\\r\\n Differences in the timing of cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument, also a different day count \\r\\n\\r\\n The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instrument and hedged \\r\\nitem. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 35  \\r\\n\\r\\n30.09.2019 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 650 000 8 929 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial for the period 01 January 2019 to 30 September 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 350 000 1 128 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial during 2018.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Where \\r\\nthe fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be derived from \\r\\nactive markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of mathematical models. The \\r\\ninputs to these models are derived from observable market data where possible, but where observable market data is not available, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 40  \\r\\n\\r\\njudgment is required to establish fair values. For the purposes of current financial statements mentioned techniques were not used \\r\\nextensively as no such financial assets and financial liabilities exist on the statement of financial position of the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of loans to customers, customer deposits, amounts due from credit institutions and amounts due to credit institutions \\r\\nand other financial assets and liabilities’ obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the \\r\\nrates currently available for debt on similar terms and remaining maturities. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn assessing the fair value for financial assets, the management has performed a discounted cash flow analysis; up-to-date \\r\\ninformation at the assessment moment is being used for assessing cash flows. For loans where base interest rates are pegged to \\r\\nfloating market interest rates, the Group has considered the difference between the average interest margin of issued loans and the \\r\\naverage interest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has been changed (increased) \\r\\nsince issuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal to the fair value. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value of financial liabilities at amortized cost such as Loans and deposits from credit institutions and Deposits from \\r\\ncustomers, which are not on demand, have been estimated based on the discounted cash flow model using interest rates for similar \\r\\nproducts as at year end. The fair value of those financial liabilities that are on demand or have a floating interest rate has been \\r\\nestimated to be approximately equal to it’s carrying amount. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTIZED COST \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR \\r\\nCarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n30.09.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value  \\r\\n\\r\\n30.09.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value  \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortized cost     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and Balances with Central banks 2 399 684 2 399 684 3 293 090 3 293 090 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 174 939 174 939 185 346 185 346 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 10 760 156 10 771 550 11 472 138 11 484 286 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 13 334 779 13 346 173 14 950 574 14 962 722 \\r\\n\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit \\r\\n\\r\\ninstitutions  \\r\\n1 330 506 1 319 380 3 939 396 3 906 454 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 9 923 439 9 954 653 9 069 885 9 098 414 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 658 393 658 393 351 235 351 235 \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liabilities 58 710 58 710 0 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 49 167     49 167     27 914    27 914    \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 12 020 215 12 040 303 13 388 430 13 384 017 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarizes the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities.

estimate the fair values: \\r\\n\\r\\n Cash and cash balances with central banks – very liquid and short-term, so the fair value equals to their carrying amount as the \\r\\n\\r\\nassets can be realized at same price in an orderly transaction \\r\\n\\r\\n Due from other credit institutions – very liquid and short-term, so the fair value equals to their carrying amount as the assets \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 30 September 2019 \\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n 43  \\r\\n\\r\\ncan be realized at same price in an orderly transaction \\r\\n\\r\\n Derivative financial instruments - fair value for this kind of instruments is calculated using discounted cash flow method through \\r\\n\\r\\nwhich net present value (NPV) is obtained. Independently sourced market parameters – mainly zero coupon yield curves with \\r\\n\\r\\ndifferent characteristics – are used to get discount factors.  To some derivatives hedge accounting rules are applicable.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (Pension Funds) - The value date method is used in the acquisition of pension \\r\\n\\r\\nfund units managed by Luminor Pensions Estonia AS and they are initially recognised at acquisition cost, which is the fair value \\r\\n\\r\\npaid for them. Investments into pension fund units have quoted prices from the market, however the market is inactive and \\r\\n\\r\\ntherefore these are classified as level 2 investments. Information about the NAV of pension funds is made publicly available by \\r\\n\\r\\nthe funds on a daily basis; investments of the managed funds subject for NAV accounting are all categorized as Level 1 \\r\\n\\r\\nInstruments. \\r\\n\\r\\n Loans to customers – Fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows using the market interest rates \\r\\n\\r\\nprevailing at each year-end. Loans are issued on market conditions; For loans, where base interest rates are pegged to floating \\r\\n\\r\\nmarket interest rates, the Group has considered difference between average interest margin of issued loans and average \\r\\n\\r\\ninterest margin for newly issued loans. Given that for part of the loan portfolio this margin has been changed (increased) since \\r\\n\\r\\nissuance, the Group has estimated that for such loans the carrying value is considered equal to fair value. \\r\\n\\r\\n Loans and deposits from credit institutions- pricing is under market conditions; fair value of deposits do not differ from the \\r\\n\\r\\ncarrying value.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Deposits from customers- pricing of the deposits is under market conditions, the fair value of deposits has been determined \\r\\n\\r\\nusing the future cashflows, fair value of deposits do not differ from the carrying value. \\r\\n\\r\\n Debt securities issued - initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortized cost. \\r\\n\\r\\nBonds are listed but liquidity and market conditions do not allow using market price as reliable input. Management has \\r\\n\\r\\ndetermined the fair value by discounting the future cash flows, using the market interest yield curve. Additional info in  Note 11 \\r\\n\\r\\nwhere impact from hedge accounting is explained. \\r\\n\\r\\n Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income - The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value \\r\\n\\r\\nmeasurement of shares on level 3 (Visa Inc. and Swift shares) are as follows: conversion rate, trading price, liquidity discount. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe management believes that reasonably possible changes to other unobservable inputs would not result in a significant \\r\\n\\r\\nchange in the estimated fair value. Change in fair value of level 3 instruments between 31 December 2018 and 30 September \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 is due to revaluation. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fair value measurement for liabilities is based on the calculation using non observable inputs thus the same categorization as \\r\\nfor assets should be applied. \\r\\n\\r\\n20. RELATED PARTIES \\r\\n\\r\\nParties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the \\r\\nother party in making financial or operational decisions.   \\r\\n\\r\\nRelated parties are defined as shareholders, members of the Supervisory Council and the Management Board as key management \\r\\npersonnel, their close relatives and companies in which they have a controlling interest as well as associated companies. \\r\\n\\r\\nParent company is considered to be Luminor Holding AS and the ultimate owners are considered to be DNB Bank ASA, Nordea Bank \\r\\nAB and Blackstone. \\r\\n\\r\\nA number of banking transactions are entered into with related parties in the normal course of business.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief Operating \\r\\nDecision Maker (CODM) as required by IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as Management Board. The Management \\r\\nBoard monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation \\r\\nand performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit before tax and is measured consistently with \\r\\nprofit before tax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest income is reported net of expenses after internal funds transfer \\r\\npricing, as management primarily relies on net interest revenue across product categories as a performance measure. Fees and \\r\\ncommission income for segment performance is also reported net of expenses and split is made between different product \\r\\ncategories for segment reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth Management. \\r\\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the CODM. Corporate Banking \\r\\nsegment services business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager. Retail Banking segment services business \\r\\ncustomers without a dedicated relationship manager and private individuals not belonging to Wealth Management segment. \\r\\nWealth Management services wealthy private individuals and holding companies associated with those individuals. Results of other \\r\\noperating segments are included in Other segment. \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective segments \\r\\n(including internal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Unallocated segment) and income and expenses \\r\\nnot booked on customer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using internally agreed allocation mechanisms. \\r\\nOnly assets and liabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating segments are reported under the respective segments, \\r\\nall other balance sheet items are reported under Other segment. \\r\\n\\r\\nStarting from 2019, new operating model got implemented in Luminor Group and CODM started monitoring operating segments on \\r\\nthe new basis (as described above). Restatement was made for historic periods for comparability.

A lot of \\r\\n\\r\\ngood work has been done in separating Luminor from its former parent banks, building the foundations for an \\r\\n\\r\\nindependent bank and strengthening the organisation. We have also succeeded in changing our funding structure \\r\\n\\r\\nquite substantially and in boosting our overall financial resilience, as we have reduced the loan-to-deposit ratio over \\r\\n\\r\\nthe past year from 126.5% to 99.9%. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 December, the European Central Bank issued a licence to Luminor to issue covered bonds. This is another \\r\\n\\r\\nimportant step towards reaching a fully independent funding structure and in continuing to improve our stability and \\r\\n\\r\\nliquidity position. Luminor is the first bank in the Baltic countries to receive such a licence, and this marks an important \\r\\n\\r\\nmilestone in the development of Baltic financial markets. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter, Luminor also continued building its payment infrastructure and information systems to be \\r\\n\\r\\nindependent of former parent banks. We completed the carve-out of SEPA payment flows, which means that all our \\r\\n\\r\\nSEPA payments are now routed and processed through the Luminor Payment Hub and the Latvian Central Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant progress was also made in establishing an independent correspondent banking network.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor’s Products and Offering team launched Luminor Investor platform in Lithuania and Latvia as a platform tailored \\r\\n\\r\\nfor investors with different levels of experience and offering over 14,500 financial instruments. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team continued to focus on total customer asset growth in deposits and investments, while the \\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate Banking team was preparing to return to lending growth after successfully repricing the legacy portfolios \\r\\n\\r\\nand reducing the portfolio of non-performing loans. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur Wealth Management segment concentrated on growing the business and on customer satisfaction. The pension \\r\\n\\r\\nassets under management reached EUR 1.45 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, which was 20% more than in the \\r\\n\\r\\nsame quarter of 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to adapt in a constantly changing environment, we continued to invest in the systems and processes that we \\r\\n\\r\\nhave developed to prevent, detect, manage and report potential financial crime risk. In the fourth quarter, 68 \\r\\n\\r\\ncompliance-related training events were organized at Luminor with coverage over 17 different topics. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic states remain some of the faster-growing economies of the EU, outpacing the euro area average by a solid \\r\\n\\r\\nmargin. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Luminor completed an important part of its overall transformation. After \\r\\n\\r\\nrightsizing the organisation and repricing the bank’s portfolio, Luminor is now ready to enter a stage of growth. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nErkki Raasuke \\r\\n\\r\\nCEO \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n4  \\r\\n\\r\\nMANAGEMENT REPORT \\r\\n\\r\\nOverview \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS (“Luminor”) was established on 1 October 2017 by the merger of the operations in the Baltic states \\r\\n\\r\\nof DNB Bank ASA (Commercial Register no. 984 851 006) and Nordea Bank AB (currently Nordea Bank Abp, as Nordea \\r\\n\\r\\nhas been domiciled in Finland since 1 October 2018 following the cross-border reversed merger between Nordea Bank \\r\\n\\r\\nAB (publ) and Nordea Bank Abp, registration no. 2858394-9) to create a new-generation financial service provider for \\r\\n\\r\\nlocal businesses and financially active people.   \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 2019 it was announced that the transaction signed on 13 September 2018 between DNB Bank ASA \\r\\n\\r\\nand Nordea Bank AB and the US-based private equity firm Blackstone had been closed, and as a result a consortium \\r\\n\\r\\nled by private equity funds managed by Blackstone acquired a 60% majority stake in the bank. The bank’s initial owners \\r\\n\\r\\nNordea Bank Abp (\"Nordea\") and DNB Bank ASA (\"DNB\") each retained a 20% equity stake in Luminor, but an \\r\\n\\r\\nagreement has been signed by Blackstone and Nordea for the purchase of Nordea’s 20% stake over the coming years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is the third-largest provider of financial services in the Baltics, with approximately 1 million clients, 2489 \\r\\n\\r\\nemployees, and market share of 16.6% in deposits and 18.7% in lending as at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal shareholders’ equity amounts to EUR 1.6 billion and Luminor is capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 19.7%. Luminor’s \\r\\n\\r\\nvision is to become the best financial ecosystem for its customers.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor offers a wide range of products and services to its customers through all possible channels, digital and \\r\\n\\r\\nphysical, with a total of 34 customer service centres, of which 8 are meet-up points, in total in Latvia, Lithuania and \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia. Luminor owns 357 ATMs throughout the Baltic states, and additionally provides services through 100 ATMs in \\r\\n\\r\\npartnership with other financial services providers. \\r\\n\\r\\n31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n  Estonia Latvia Lithuania GroupGr Total  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of customers ~134 000 ~229 000 ~577 000 ~940 000 \\r\\n\\r\\nMarket shares      \\r\\n\\r\\nLending 13.9% 23.0% 20.3% 18.7% \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits 9.9% 17.5% 21.2% 16.6% \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of client service \\r\\n\\r\\ncentres, including meet- \\r\\n\\r\\nup points \\r\\n\\r\\n8 10 16 34  \\r\\n\\r\\nNumber of employees 577 887 1025 2489 \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of fourth quarter Luminor had 24 subsidiaries in the Baltics: Luminor Asset Management IPAS (Latvia), \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds AS (Latvia), UAB Luminor Investiciju valdymas (Lithuania), and Luminor Pensions \\r\\n\\r\\nEstonia AS (Estonia) manage pension assets; Recurso UAB (Lithuania), Promano Lit UAB (Lithuania), Industrius UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n(Lithuania), Gėlužės projektai LUAB (Lithuania), Intractus UAB (Lithuania), Promano Estonia OÜ (Estonia), Luminor \\r\\n\\r\\nFinance SIA (Latvia), Realm SIA (Latvia), Trioleta SIA (Latvia), Baltic ipašums SIA (Latvia), Promano Lat SIA (Latvia),  Salvus \\r\\n\\r\\nSIA (Latvia), Salvus 2 SIA (Latvia), Salvus 3 SIA (Latvia), Salvus 4 SIA (Latvia), and Salvus 6 SIA (Latvia) are property \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n5  \\r\\n\\r\\nmanagement companies; and Luminor Liising AS (Estonia), Luminor Līzings SIA (Latvia), Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n(Latvia), and Luminor Lizingas UAB (Lithuania) provide leasing services.     \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 October, the Supervisory Council of Luminor elected Georg Kaltenbrunner as a member of the bank’s \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement Board and new Chief Risk Officer. Georg Kaltenbrunner took over the position on 1 November from \\r\\n\\r\\nHannu Saksala.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 December 2019, the European Central Bank issued a licence to Luminor to issue covered bonds following the \\r\\n\\r\\nassessment of the Estonian Financial Supervision Authority. Luminor is the first bank in the Baltic states to receive such \\r\\n\\r\\na licence. \\r\\n\\r\\nMacroeconomic overview  \\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal trade and the global economy continued to soften on the back of trade uncertainty, heightened geopolitical \\r\\n\\r\\nrisks, and a slowdown in manufacturing that spread to other parts of the global economy, albeit to a limited degree. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdvanced and emerging markets experienced headwinds with weaker economic confidence and growth resting largely \\r\\n\\r\\non domestic demand as the key driver. While global manufacturing is still experiencing substantial weakness, there \\r\\n\\r\\nare early signs of stabilisation. Services are poised to face soft growth as there has so far been limited spill-over to \\r\\n\\r\\nthe more strongly performing services sector, which benefits from domestic demand and supportive financial \\r\\n\\r\\nconditions. There has been a tepid recovery to an uninspiring level of growth, but with diminished economic and \\r\\n\\r\\npolicy risks. \\r\\n\\r\\nGrowth moderated in the key export markets for the Baltics, including the euro area and the Nordic countries, and the \\r\\n\\r\\noutlook for growth was subdued. Growth in the euro area, the key destination for Baltic exports, decelerated noticeably, \\r\\n\\r\\nwith GDP growing only by around 1.2% year on year, and 0.2% quarter on quarter in the second and third quarters of \\r\\n\\r\\n2019, reflecting a drag from industry and trade. The risk of a hard Brexit added to the economic uncertainty in the UK \\r\\n\\r\\nand in related EU economies. The euro area slowdown is now showing tentative signs of bottoming out as the \\r\\n\\r\\neconomies that are more open to global trade, including Germany, go through a soft patch. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic states along with Ireland, Poland, Hungary and some southern European peers like Malta today have some \\r\\n\\r\\nof the fastest growing economies in the EU. The Baltic economies have expanded robustly, outpacing the euro area \\r\\n\\r\\naverage by a solid margin, with annual real GDP growth averaging 5% in Estonia and around 4% in Latvia and Lithuania \\r\\n\\r\\nsince 2017. The average in the euro area meanwhile was 2%.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Baltic countries have exceeded expectations and have so far largely escaped disruption to trade, as they sustained \\r\\n\\r\\nsofter, but still broadly based, momentum in their economies in the third quarter, benefiting not least from investment, \\r\\n\\r\\nconsumption and healthy residential construction. Annual growth in the third quarter was 4.1% in Estonia, 1.9% in \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvia and 3.6% in Lithuania, as the growth trend remained moderate. \\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the external headwinds and the slower expansion in key export markets, growth has started to weaken gradually, \\r\\n\\r\\nalbeit from high levels, but labour markets are still firm and tight. The economies are integrated, so all the European \\r\\n\\r\\neconomies will go through the current cyclical softness in trade to different degrees, and will face headwinds for export \\r\\n\\r\\ndemand.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n6  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe expect growth to weaken only gradually given the continued support from strong labour markets and healthy \\r\\n\\r\\ndomestic demand, which remain the key engine of growth. The consumer still holds strong in advanced countries \\r\\n\\r\\nincluding the Baltic states and the labour markets remain tight, though there are early signs of wage and labour \\r\\n\\r\\ndemand moderating in future from their current robust levels.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the first phase of the trade deal between the US and China signed, there is more cautious optimism about a \\r\\n\\r\\nrecovery in global trade. The worst may be over for European manufacturers, while domestic demand is still robust \\r\\n\\r\\nand unemployment is close to a record low.   \\r\\n\\r\\nActivities \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor completed its cross-border merger on 2 January 2019 and continues its operations in all the three Baltic \\r\\n\\r\\nstates through the bank headquartered in Estonia and its branches in Latvia and Lithuania. After the completion of the \\r\\n\\r\\nmerger, all the assets, rights and liabilities of Luminor Bank AS (Latvia) and Luminor Bank AB (Lithuania) were transferred \\r\\n\\r\\nto Luminor Bank AS in Estonia. The bank continues its activities in Latvia and Lithuania through its locally established \\r\\n\\r\\nbranches. A new organisational set up and a new governance structure were also introduced, and new members of \\r\\n\\r\\nthe management bodies were appointed. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the cross-border merger, the deposits and holdings in financial instruments of the customers of Luminor \\r\\n\\r\\nBank AS Latvian branch and Luminor Bank AS Lithuanian branch are guaranteed by the deposit guarantee and investor \\r\\n\\r\\nprotection scheme established and operated by the Estonian Guarantee Fund.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor continued to roll out the new operating model during the fourth quarter by simplifying its structure and \\r\\n\\r\\ndecision-making process, unifying and executing IT consolidation, strengthening its controls, and becoming more \\r\\n\\r\\nefficient, more resilient and more resolvable.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Luminor continued building its payment infrastructure and information systems that are \\r\\n\\r\\nindependent of its former parent banks. In November 2019, \\u202fLuminor completed the carve out of SEPA payment flows \\r\\n\\r\\nso that all the SEPA payments as of that date are routed and processed through the Luminor Payment Hub and the \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvian Central Bank. Luminor has also established its own correspondent banking network and carved out the \\r\\n\\r\\ninternational payment flows that were previously routed and processed via the systems and correspondent banking \\r\\n\\r\\naccounts of DNB Bank. Luminor is also progressing with the equivalent change to international payment flows \\r\\n\\r\\nprocessed through the Nordea Group, with plans to become fully independent during the first half of 2020.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe gradual migration of the legacy Nordea customers to the Luminor information systems continued in Latvia, \\r\\n\\r\\nresulting in the successful transfer of some 30% of active legacy Nordea customers by the end of 2019.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, Luminor started issuing Qualified Smart ID, which is a digital authentication tool with \\r\\n\\r\\nqualified e-signature, in its customer services centres. The launch was made in all three Baltic countries. Around 92% \\r\\n\\r\\nof new customers use this solution to access the bank’s digital channels. It creates a way to deliver and sign up for \\r\\n\\r\\nmore complex products through digital channels in the very near future. \\r\\n\\r\\nPRODUCT AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Luminor continued the migration of customer and product data and services to the \\r\\n\\r\\nunified Luminor system in Latvia. The process of migrating the customers to the targeted unified systems is progressing \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n7  \\r\\n\\r\\naccording to plan and will be finalised in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia in 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn October the Luminor Investor platform was launched in Lithuania and Latvia. The investment platform is tailored for \\r\\n\\r\\ninvestors of all levels of experience and offers a wide range of non-complex financial instruments, with more than \\r\\n\\r\\n14,500. The platform was built jointly with Scandinavian partners and provides a simplified customer experience and \\r\\n\\r\\nthe option for customers to build their savings at their own pace. The launch of the platform in Estonia is planned for \\r\\n\\r\\nthe first quarter of 2020. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RETAIL BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team continued to focus on growing total customer assets in deposits and investments. After the \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Investor platform was launched, more than 100 retail customers started to use it and the total portfolio \\r\\n\\r\\ninvested through the platform by retail customers reached 650 thousand EUR at the end of the year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe team also executed a sales campaign for the third pillar pension across the Baltics and achieved a new record \\r\\n\\r\\nsales portfolio of 7.4 million EUR.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Retail Banking team continued to consolidate the distribution channels and improve efficiency in related areas. \\r\\n\\r\\nThree new concept meet-up points were opened in Lithuania during the fourth quarter, and at the end of the fourth \\r\\n\\r\\nquarter, Luminor was serving its customers in a total of 34 locations across the Baltics.    \\r\\n\\r\\nThe team continued to put its emphasis on advancing customer service quality as well, so frontline advisory training \\r\\n\\r\\nsessions were held, and 345 advisors and managers were trained during the extensive practical training sessions. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CORPORATE BANKING SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019 the Corporate Banking team continued to focus on increasing the profitability of our \\r\\n\\r\\ncorporate lending portfolio and reducing the portfolio of non-performing loans. The team also succeeded in increasing \\r\\n\\r\\nthe corporate deposit portfolio during the quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nLoan loss provisions in the fourth quarter were higher than in the previous year because of additional provisions for \\r\\n\\r\\nthe non-performing loan book. The macro environment continues to be very supportive. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEALTH MANAGEMENT SEGMENT  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main focus in the Wealth Management segment in the fourth quarter was on growing the business, with the focus \\r\\n\\r\\non high customer satisfaction and preparing for the possible changes in the pension system in Estonia.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCollaboration with other business segments supported both growth and customer satisfaction in the Private Banking \\r\\n\\r\\nand the Pensions segments.    \\r\\n\\r\\nAll the major Management Board level re-appointments have been made for the Luminor pension entities, and \\r\\n\\r\\napprovals have been received from the local financial supervisory authorities. To facilitate an orderly transition, multiple \\r\\n\\r\\nworkshops have been held to map functional responsibilities and conflicts of interest, as in the quality and risk analysis \\r\\n\\r\\n(QRA) framework.     \\r\\n\\r\\nThe pension assets under management in the Baltics reached EUR 1.45 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, increasing \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n8  \\r\\n\\r\\nby 20% from the same quarter of 2018. Total assets under management have grown solidly as financial markets have \\r\\n\\r\\nperformed well and the external sales channel for pension products in Estonia has been successful.   \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor had 295 thousand second pillar and 62 thousand third pillar pension customers at the end of the quarter.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Private Banking team focused on growing the assets under management and reached EUR 1.42 billion in the \\r\\n\\r\\nfourth quarter of 2019, increasing by 19% from the same quarter of 2018. The focus remains on ensuring a high level \\r\\n\\r\\nof customer satisfaction by helping affluent and high net worth individuals and their families to grow, manage and \\r\\n\\r\\npreserve their wealth. During the quarter the Private Banking team introduced a new VISA Infinite card for the Private \\r\\n\\r\\nBanking segment in Latvia. Lithuania and Estonia will follow.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter Luminor continued with the review of its ESG principles and how they are implemented, and \\r\\n\\r\\ncontinued with its efforts to promote financial literacy and education and to support sustainable business and local \\r\\n\\r\\nentrepreneurship.  \\r\\n\\r\\nA range of financial literacy classes and talks were given to school children, and lectures on saving and on pensions \\r\\n\\r\\nwere given to university students. Initiatives to promote digital literacy and cyber security were supported. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor organised a series of seminars for its customers to support an entrepreneurial attitude and share best practices \\r\\n\\r\\nin building and maintaining a sustainable career or business, with advice on marketing, insurance, finance, and work-\\r\\n\\r\\nlife balance. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor sold 28 works of art at an auction, the proceeds of which were donated to create an interdisciplinary computer \\r\\n\\r\\nscience course, the Baltic IT Leadership Bachelor Program, launched by Riga Technical University and the University of \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvia in cooperation with the State University of New York at Buffalo, USA. The programme is run by the Riga Business \\r\\n\\r\\nSchool of RTU and gives 22 young people a chance to start their studies on the new course. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to all that, a Luminor scholarship was awarded to one university student to promote new ideas in local \\r\\n\\r\\ntechnology and the local economy, and to help reduce the ecological footprint. \\r\\n\\r\\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING EFFORTS  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor is continuously committed to preventing and detecting money laundering and financial crime, reviewing its \\r\\n\\r\\nAML practices regularly, and investing in the necessary human and technological capabilities in this field. As it is subject \\r\\n\\r\\nto a range of legal requirements, Luminor acts in full transparency and in collaboration with all the relevant supervisory \\r\\n\\r\\nand regulatory authorities. Luminor predominantly serves residents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and customers \\r\\n\\r\\nwith a strong personal or business connection to the Baltic states. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor has developed and implemented a financial crime risk management framework to prevent, detect, manage \\r\\n\\r\\nand report potential financial crime risk. The framework consists of financial crime detection technology, comprehensive \\r\\n\\r\\npolicies and procedures, regular risk assessments, training and awareness-raising, and ongoing monitoring of new and \\r\\n\\r\\ndeveloping financial crime risks. In addition, Luminor follows international guidelines, recommendations and standards \\r\\n\\r\\nissued by the regulatory and supervisory authorities, relevant international bodies, local banking associations and \\r\\n\\r\\nfinancial intelligence units in each Baltic state. Luminor continuously invests in its systems and processes to adapt in a \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n9  \\r\\n\\r\\nconstantly changing environment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor considers awareness raising activities as an important component of the financial crime risk management \\r\\n\\r\\nframework. During the fourth quarter, 68 compliance-related training events were held on 17 different topics.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEVENTS AFTER 31 DECEMBER 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 January Moody\\'s Investors Service assigned a provisional (P) Aa1 long-term rating to the mortgage covered \\r\\n\\r\\nbonds to be issued by Luminor Bank AS, under by the Estonian Covered Bonds Act. The credit analysis by Moody’s \\r\\n\\r\\nconsidered among other things the credit quality of the assets backing the covered bonds, the Estonian legal \\r\\n\\r\\nframework providing for regulation and supervision of the issuer, and the cover pool exposure to market risk and the \\r\\n\\r\\nlevel of over-collateralisation.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n10  \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial Results \\r\\n\\r\\nThe funding structure continued to change during the quarter leading to an increase of 12.9% in the deposits portfolio \\r\\n\\r\\nand a decline of 10.9% in the loan portfolio from a year earlier. The loan-to-deposit ratio has fallen from 126.5% to \\r\\n\\r\\n99.9% over the past 12 months. Net profit in the fourth quarter was by EUR 0.7 million higher than in the same period \\r\\n\\r\\nof 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income fell from EUR 65.3 million in the fourth quarter of the previous year to EUR 55.0 million in that \\r\\n\\r\\nquarter of 2019. Interest income remained at a similar level to what it was a year earlier thanks to the successful right-\\r\\n\\r\\nsizing of the business to ensure fair and rational pricing of risk. Interest expenses increased by EUR 8.0 million as a \\r\\n\\r\\nresult of the continuous work to become an independently funded bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal operating expenses in the fourth quarter were EUR 78.4 million, which is EUR 7.5 million higher than last year. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe result is mainly explained by the transformation costs incurred. Exceptional costs in the fourth quarter were EUR \\r\\n\\r\\n19.2 million, of which 88% were IT expenses for technology developments and the rest were other transformation \\r\\n\\r\\ncosts. \\r\\n\\r\\nImpairment of loans to customers were EUR 11.7 million in the fourth quarter, which is EUR 5.6 million higher than \\r\\n\\r\\nthey were in the same period of the previous year, while the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio continued to improve \\r\\n\\r\\nto 3.8%. \\r\\n\\r\\nKey figures and ratios of Luminor*   \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR \\r\\nQ4 Q3  Q4        January-December \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 2019 2018 2019 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet profit 4 032 16 887 3 333 53 997 123 447 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity 1 633 540 1 624 589 1 793 679 1 715 240 1 756 227 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE), % 1.0 4.1 0.7 3.1 7.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets 13 764 821 13 905 118 15 012 427 14 523 417 15 201 099 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA), % 0.1 0.5 0.1 0.4 0.8 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income 54 969 62 104 65 275 244 167 259 409 \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets 13 458 875 13 579 747 14 739 778 14 192 831 14 844 146 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM), % 1.6 1.8 1.8 1.7 1.7 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio (C/I), % 82.8 73.5 74.5 77.6 63.0 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio, %*** 0.44 0.33 0.21 0.22 -0.05 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 10 222 547 10 760 156 11 472 138 10 222 547 11 472 138 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 10 235 443 9 923 439 9 069 885 10 235 443 9 069 885 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio, % 99.9 108.4 126.5 99.9 126.5 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET1 ratio, % 19.7 18.7 18.0** 19.7 18.0** \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio (gross), % 3.8 4.3 5.3** 3.8 5.3** \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest income / Loans, % 2.1 2.3 2.3 2.4 2.3 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n11  \\r\\n\\r\\n* Quarterly ratios and Jan-Dec 2019 ratios (ROE, ROA, NIM, C/I, Credit impairment ratio) are expressed on an annualised basis \\r\\n\\r\\n**Luminor Group AB full year consolidated figures     \\r\\n\\r\\n***If loan recoveries prevail, the ratio is negative \\r\\n\\r\\nExplanations  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage equity (belonging to the owners of the company) = (equity at the end of the reporting period + equity at the end of the previous \\r\\n\\r\\nperiod) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on equity (ROE) = Net profit / Average equity * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage assets = (assets at the end of the reporting period + assets at the end of the previous period) / 2  \\r\\n\\r\\nReturn on assets (ROA) = Net profit / Average assets * 100  \\r\\n\\r\\nAverage interest earning assets = (interest-earning assets at the end of the reporting period + interest-earning assets at the end of the \\r\\n\\r\\nprevious period) / 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nNet interest margin (NIM) = Net interest income / Average interest earning assets * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCost / Income ratio = Total operating expenses / Net total operating income * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCredit impairment ratio = Net losses or reversal on loans to customers / Net loans, average * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans / Deposits ratio = Loans to customers / Deposits from customers * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nCET 1 ratio = Common Equity Tier 1 Capital / Risk-weighted Assets \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio = Gross impaired loans (Stage 3 loans) / Gross loans * 100 \\r\\n\\r\\nLENDING AND DEPOSITS  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers totalled EUR 10.2 billion at the end of fourth quarter, having been EUR 11.5 billion previous year. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition of loans has changed slightly during the past 12 months as the share of loans to individual customers \\r\\n\\r\\nhas increased from 51% to 55% and share of loans to business customers has declined from 46% to 43%, at Baltic \\r\\n\\r\\nlevel.

The share of impaired loans in the total loan portfolio, shown as the \\r\\n\\r\\nNPL ratio, was 3.8% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, down 0.5 percentage point from the previous quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe NPL ratio for the mortgage loans portfolio stood at 2.9% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, down 0.4 \\r\\n\\r\\npercentage point from the previous quarter. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe reduction of EUR 81.6 million in the amount of impaired loans was faster than the reduction of EUR 13.4 million \\r\\n\\r\\nin allowances for impaired loans, and this increased the Stage 3 impairment ratio. At the end of the fourth quarter of \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 the ratio of allowances to impaired loans, shown as the Stage 3 impairment ratio, stood at 36.7%, which was up \\r\\n\\r\\n3.5 percentage points on the previous quarter. The level of allowances for impaired mortgage loans alone was 26.3% \\r\\n\\r\\nat the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe impairment ratio for the total loan portfolio did not change significantly during the quarter and was 1.8% at the \\r\\n\\r\\nend of the fourth quarter of 2019.

Deposits from customers are the main \\r\\n\\r\\nsource of funding for Luminor and made up EUR 10.2 billion or 74.5% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity at \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n17  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe end of the fourth quarter of 2019, having been EUR 9.9 billion or 72.0% at the end of the third quarter. The funding \\r\\n\\r\\nbase is predominantly EUR-denominated. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to deposits, Luminor also has outstanding debt securities and funding from its former parent banks, DNB \\r\\n\\r\\nBank ASA and Nordea Bank Abp, that together constitute a substantial part of the funding base. At the end of the \\r\\n\\r\\nfourth quarter of 2019 the value of outstanding bonds under the EMTN programme totalled EUR 652 million, with the \\r\\n\\r\\ntransaction of 11 June 2019 building on the inaugural transaction of EUR 350 million from October 2018. The Senior \\r\\n\\r\\nUnsecured Medium-Term Note Program has been assigned a rating of Baa2 by Moody’s. \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, funding from former parents amounted to EUR 905 million and was provided \\r\\n\\r\\nby DNB Bank ASA and Nordea Bank Abp in the form of a syndicate, where each syndicate partner provides 50%. \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the changes in the ownership of Luminor, a new wording of the facility agreement has come into force from \\r\\n\\r\\nthe fourth quarter of 2019. The total amount committed to the facility under the new agreement (used and un-used \\r\\n\\r\\ncombined) is EUR 2,837 million at the closure of the Blackstone transaction. The facility amount is committed for five \\r\\n\\r\\nyears from 1 October 2019 and it can be drawn with maturities of one, two or three years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the facility is partly secured, as Luminor has assigned mortgage loans with a carrying value of EUR 1,929 \\r\\n\\r\\nmillion as collateral. The pledge on the mortgage loans is applicable from 25 September 2019. The reduction in the \\r\\n\\r\\noverall limit of the new wording facility agreement with DNB and Nordea means that the total committed but unused \\r\\n\\r\\ncredit line was EUR 1,932 million as at the of the fourth quarter of 2019. \\r\\n\\r\\nRating  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 September 2018, Moody’s assigned Luminor long and short-term, foreign and local currency deposit ratings of \\r\\n\\r\\nBaa1/Prime-2, with a stable outlook. There have been no changes to Luminor’s ratings since then.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOn 13 January 2020, Moody’s assigned a provisional (P) Aa1 long-term rating to the mortgage covered bonds issued \\r\\n\\r\\nby Luminor Bank AS, which are governed by the Estonian Covered Bonds Act. \\r\\n\\r\\n314\\r\\n\\r\\n4 578\\r\\n4 034\\r\\n\\r\\n1 623\\r\\n\\r\\n905\\r\\n652\\r\\n\\r\\n1 632\\r\\n\\r\\nAll other\\r\\nLiabilities*\\r\\n\\r\\nCorporate\\r\\ndeposits\\r\\n\\r\\nRetail deposits Public sector\\r\\ndeposits\\r\\n\\r\\nParent Funding Senior Issuance Equity\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n18  \\r\\n\\r\\nLIQUIDITY  \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor uses different metrics to measure liquidity risk. One metric used is the LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio). The \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR for Luminor was 149.8% as at the end of the fourth quarter by the CRR LCR definition. The liquidity buffer is \\r\\n\\r\\ncomposed of highly liquid central bank eligible securities and cash. Long-term liquidity risk is measured as the Net \\r\\n\\r\\nStable Funding Ratio (NSFR). As at the end of fourth quarter of 2019, Luminor’s NSFR was 123.0%. The NSFR increased \\r\\n\\r\\nby 5.0% from the third quarter of 2019, when it was 118.0%, mainly due to the decline of the loan portfolio, which \\r\\n\\r\\nrequires stable funding. \\r\\n\\r\\n(percentage) Q4  2019 Q3  2019 Q2  2019 Q1 2019 Q4  2018* \\r\\n\\r\\nLCR 149.8% 144.3% 132.5% 131.2% 189% \\r\\n\\r\\nNSFR 123.0% 118.0% 127.4% 122.0% 114.0% \\r\\n\\r\\n* Luminor Group AB consolidated figures \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposit structure  \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers are predominantly from residents of the Baltics.

The Total Capital Ratio of Luminor was 19.7% as at the end of the fourth \\r\\n\\r\\nquarter of 2019, which is comfortably above the internal target of 17.0%. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Total Capital Ratio is fully covered by Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Luminor uses the Standardised method \\r\\n\\r\\nin the Capital Adequacy calculations to calculate credit and market risk.

Luminor Bank AS current owners, Nordea Bank Abp \\r\\n\\r\\n(\"Nordea\") and DNB BANK ASA (\"DNB\"), each retains a 20% equity stake in the Bank. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 December 2019 Luminor Bank AS directly or indirectly owned majority in the following subsidiaries (100%): \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Estonia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country  \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Latvia: \\r\\n\\r\\nRegistered country \\r\\n\\r\\nRepublic of Lithuania: \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Liising AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Pensions Estonia \\r\\n\\r\\nAS \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Estonia OÜ  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Asset Management IPAS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Finance SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Latvijas atklātais pensiju fonds \\r\\n\\r\\nAS \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Līzings SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Līzings Latvija SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Lat SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Realm SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 2 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 3 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 4 SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Salvus 6 SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n Trioleta SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Baltic ipasšums SIA \\r\\n\\r\\n Industrius UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Intractus UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Promano Lit UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Recurso UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Investiciju \\r\\n\\r\\nValdymas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Luminor Lizingas UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n Gėlužės projektai UAB \\r\\n\\r\\n(under liquidation) \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n31  \\r\\n\\r\\nAs at 31 December 2019 Luminor Bank AS had ownership in the following associated companies (25%): \\r\\n\\r\\n ALD Automotive AS  \\r\\n\\r\\n ALD Automotive SIA  \\r\\n\\r\\n ALD Automotive UAB  \\r\\n\\r\\n SIA Kredītinformācijas Birojs \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS (the Bank or the Group) was prepared \\r\\n\\r\\nin accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed consolidated \\r\\n\\r\\ninterim financial information does not contain all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial \\r\\n\\r\\nstatements and should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements of Luminor Bank AS for the year \\r\\n\\r\\nended 31 December 2018. As described in the section Accounting for the merger below, following the merger on 2 \\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 2019, the condensed consolidated interim financial information includes the financial information for 3 merged \\r\\n\\r\\nbanks, therefore for the purpose of obtaining annual financial information for the same group of entities, we advise \\r\\n\\r\\nthe reader to also refer to the consolidated annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 of \\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS’s parent entity, Luminor Group AB (holding), available at https://www.luminor.ee/en/financial-reports. \\r\\n\\r\\nThose consolidated financial statements represent substantially the financial position and results of the 3 merged \\r\\n\\r\\nbanks, with certain minor additional balances and transactions from Luminor Group AB (holding) entity. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial information are \\r\\n\\r\\nconsistent with those followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS annual financial statements for the year \\r\\n\\r\\nended 31 December 2018, except for the additional policy for accounting for the merger, and adoption of new and \\r\\n\\r\\namended standards as set out below. \\r\\n\\r\\nACCOUNTING FOR THE MERGER \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS does not prescribe the method of accounting for transactions under common control. Pursuant to IAS 8, \\r\\n\\r\\nmanagement has determined that the merger is accounted for using the predecessor method of accounting. Under \\r\\n\\r\\nthis method the financial statements are presented as if the businesses had been combined from the beginning of the \\r\\n\\r\\nearliest period presented (or the date that the entities were brought under common control, if later). The assets and \\r\\n\\r\\nliabilities of the banks transferred under common control are recognised at their predecessor values, i.e at their carrying \\r\\n\\r\\nvalues from the financial statements at the highest level of consolidation (i.e. Luminor Group AB (holding)). No new \\r\\n\\r\\ngoodwill arises under predecessor method. Any difference between the consideration given and the aggregate book \\r\\n\\r\\nvalue of the assets and liabilities (as of the date of the transaction) of the acquired entity is included in equity. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the completion of the merger on 2 January 2019, all assets and liabilities of Luminor Bank AS, Luminor Bank \\r\\n\\r\\nLatvia and Luminor Bank Lithuania have been combined with the retrosepective effect. Therefore, 2018 comparatives \\r\\n\\r\\nin this condensed consolidated interim financial information of Luminor Bank AS include also the financial results of \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Luminor Bank Latvia and Luminor Bank Lithuania in accordance with the policy described above.  \\r\\n\\r\\nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.luminor.ee/en/financial-reports\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n32  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 Leases on the Group’s financial statements and discloses the \\r\\n\\r\\nnew accounting policies that have been applied from 1 January 2019 below.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIFRS 16 “Leases” was issued on 13 January 2016 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January \\r\\n\\r\\n2019. The new standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll leases result in the lessee obtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and, if lease payments are \\r\\n\\r\\nmade over time, also obtaining financing. Accordingly, IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating \\r\\n\\r\\nleases or finance leases as was required by IAS 17 and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Lessees \\r\\n\\r\\nare required to recognize: (a) assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the \\r\\n\\r\\nunderlying asset is of low value; and (b) using depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities \\r\\n\\r\\nin the income statement. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in IAS 17. Accordingly, \\r\\n\\r\\na lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases and account for those two types of leases \\r\\n\\r\\ndifferently. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group has elected to use the recognition exemptions for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, has a \\r\\n\\r\\nlease term of 12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option (‘short-term leases’), and lease contracts for \\r\\n\\r\\nwhich the underlying asset is of low value (‘low-value assets’). \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustments recognised on adoption of IFRS 16 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group decided that it will apply the standard using the modified retrospective method and has not restated \\r\\n\\r\\ncomparatives for the 2018 reporting period. The Group recognized a right of use asset of 30 623 thousand Euro \\r\\n\\r\\nagainst a corresponding lease liability in the amount of 33 207 thousand Euro and the impact to the equity as of 1 \\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 2019 amounts to 2 514 thousand Euro, decreasing its balance. Net impact on equity was caused by the fact \\r\\n\\r\\nthat the Group decided to recognise the right-of-use assets at the date of initial application, measuring them at their \\r\\n\\r\\ncarrying amount as if the standard had been applied since the commencement date, but discounted using the \\r\\n\\r\\nincremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease liabilities as at 1 January 2019 are reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of 31 December 2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nas follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR   \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating lease commitments disclosed as at 31 December 2018                                              36 656 \\r\\n\\r\\nWeighted average incremental borrowing rate as at 1 January 2019 2,45% \\r\\n\\r\\nDiscounted operating lease commitments at 1 January 2019 31 847 \\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\nLess  \\r\\n\\r\\nCommitments relating short-term leases  158 \\r\\n\\r\\nAdd  \\r\\n\\r\\nAdjustment as a result of a different treatment of extension and termination options 1 518 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n33  \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal lease liability recognized as at 1 January 2019 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\nOf which are:       \\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent lease liabilities   4 201 \\r\\n\\r\\nNon-current lease liabilities   29 006 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal 33 207 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe associated right-of-use assets for property leases were measured on a retrospective basis as if the new rules had \\r\\n\\r\\nalways been applied.

Rental contracts are typically made for fixed \\r\\n\\r\\nperiods of 4 to 15 years but may have extension options as described below. Lease terms are negotiated on an \\r\\n\\r\\nindividual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the 2018 financial year, leases of property, IT equipment and cars were classified as either finance or operating \\r\\n\\r\\nleases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) were charged to profit \\r\\n\\r\\nor loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.   \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1 January 2019, leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which \\r\\n\\r\\nthe leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance \\r\\n\\r\\ncost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of \\r\\n\\r\\ninterest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.  \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees \\r\\n\\r\\n(d) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option,and \\r\\n\\r\\n(e) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, \\r\\n\\r\\nthe lessee’s incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds \\r\\n\\r\\nnecessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo determine incremental borrowing rate we have considered: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. existing borrowings (own funding cost) that need to be adjusted for amount, security, term etc. and \\r\\n\\r\\n2. property yield that need to be adjusted for term, amount, quality of property, potential weighted average cost \\r\\n\\r\\nof capital (WACC) element in yields etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor property leases the Bank has decided the usage of the Bank’s own funding cost as a discount rate. For other assets \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Bank uses the interest rate implicit in the lease as discount rate, as it is readily determinable. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the Bank measured the lease liability by:  \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;  \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and  \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications (like changes in lease term, in \\r\\n\\r\\nthe assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, in the amounts expected to be payable under a residual \\r\\n\\r\\nvalue guarantee, in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n35  \\r\\n\\r\\npayments, including for example a change to reflect changes in market rental rates following a market rent review and \\r\\n\\r\\nin floating interest rates, or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments (payments are structured as variable \\r\\n\\r\\nlease payments, but there is no genuine variability in those payments and those payments contain variable clauses \\r\\n\\r\\nthat do not have real economic substance). \\r\\n\\r\\nAt the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe cost of the right-of-use asset comprises: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not \\r\\n\\r\\npaid at that date; \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received; \\r\\n\\r\\n(c) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(d) an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the \\r\\n\\r\\nsite on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of \\r\\n\\r\\nthe lease, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories. The lessee incurs the obligation for those costs either \\r\\n\\r\\nat the commencement date or as a consequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost: \\r\\n\\r\\n(a) less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses; and \\r\\n\\r\\n(b) adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease \\r\\n\\r\\nmodifications, or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset\\'s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line \\r\\n\\r\\nbasis. \\r\\n\\r\\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as \\r\\n\\r\\nan expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets \\r\\n\\r\\ncomprise IT-equipment and small items of office furniture below 5 000 EUR. \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options \\r\\n\\r\\nExtension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese terms are used to maximize operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. The majority of extension and \\r\\n\\r\\ntermination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.    \\r\\n\\r\\nIn determining the lease term, the management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive \\r\\n\\r\\nto exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination \\r\\n\\r\\noptions) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated) and \\r\\n\\r\\nbased on the assessment performed, the potential impact is immaterial. \\r\\n\\r\\nMOVEMENTS OF THE GROUP\\'S RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n36  \\r\\n\\r\\nSet out below, are the carrying amounts of the Group’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and the movements \\r\\n\\r\\nduring the period: \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR  1 January 2019 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nRight-of-use assets 30 693 54 382 \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liability 33 207 57 051 \\r\\n\\r\\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial \\r\\n\\r\\nstatements, and the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgements \\r\\n\\r\\nare continually evaluated and are based on management’s experience and other factors, including expectations of \\r\\n\\r\\nfuture events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management also makes certain judgements, \\r\\n\\r\\napart from those involving estimations, in the process of applying the accounting policies. Judgements that have the \\r\\n\\r\\nmost significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements and estimates that can \\r\\n\\r\\ncause a significant adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year include. \\r\\n\\r\\nIMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group recognizes the credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9. The Standard applies a forward-looking expected \\r\\n\\r\\ncredit loss (ECL) approach. The Group is required to recognize an allowance for expected losses for all loans and other \\r\\n\\r\\ndebt financial assets not held at FVPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. The assets \\r\\n\\r\\nto test for impairment are divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration.  Stage 1 includes \\r\\n\\r\\nassets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. In stage 1, the allowances \\r\\n\\r\\nequal the 12-month expected credit loss. Stage 2 includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit \\r\\n\\r\\nrisk and stage 3 includes defaulted assets. In stage 2 and 3, the allowances equal the lifetime expected credit losses. \\r\\n\\r\\nLoss allowances based on lifetime expected credit losses are calculated also for additional category - purchased or \\r\\n\\r\\noriginated credit-impaired assets (POCI) - regardless of the changes in credit risk during the lifetime of an instrument.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding the \\r\\n\\r\\nchoice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. The model applied was not majorly changed during the year. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe inputs and parameters were reviewed as part of regular process.  Elements of the ECL models that are considered \\r\\n\\r\\naccounting judgements and estimates include: \\r\\n\\r\\n evaluating the criteria for assessment of significant increase in credit risk and allocation of loans to stage 1 or 2;  \\r\\n\\r\\n identification of unlikely to pay criteria and assignment of loans to stage 3; \\r\\n\\r\\n assessing accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL, \\r\\n\\r\\nincluding the various formulas and the choice of inputs; \\r\\n\\r\\n the modelling and calculation of key parameters of ECL model, including probability of default (PD), loss given \\r\\n\\r\\ndefault (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD); \\r\\n\\r\\n determining the macro-economic indicators and incorporating forward-looking information into the ECL model;  \\r\\n\\r\\n estimating the above-mentioned indicators for reliable future period and for three different scenarios (baseline, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n37  \\r\\n\\r\\noptimistic and pessimistic) and assigning probabilities to those scenarios;  \\r\\n\\r\\n estimating ECL under base case and risk case scenarios for stage 3 material assets individual assessments and \\r\\n\\r\\nassigning probabilities to those scenarios; \\r\\n\\r\\n setting principles for stage 3 immaterial assets collective assessment. \\r\\n\\r\\nPlease refer to Note 12. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe condensed interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures \\r\\n\\r\\nrequired in the annual financial statements; they should be read in conjunction with the Luminor Bank AS annual \\r\\n\\r\\nfinancial statements as at 31 December 2018.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall improvements have been performed in the risk management framework, including governance, risk appetite, \\r\\n\\r\\nlimits and documentation since the end of the year 2018. \\r\\n\\r\\n4.

The swaps are being used to hedge interest rate risk exposure that is created by the \\r\\n\\r\\nissued bonds. Trade date for EUR 200 million and EUR 150 million interest swap agreements is 10 October 2018, \\r\\n\\r\\neffective date is 18 October 2018 and maturity date is 18 October 2021. For EUR 300 million interest swap agreement \\r\\n\\r\\ntrade date is 11 June 2019, effective date is 21 June 2019 and maturity date 21 October 2022. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instruments as the terms of the interest \\r\\n\\r\\nrate swaps match the terms of the fixed rate bond (i.e. notional amount, maturity and payment). The Group has \\r\\n\\r\\nestablished a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships, as the underlying risk of the interest rate swaps is \\r\\n\\r\\nidentical to the hedged risk component. To test hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method \\r\\n\\r\\nand compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument against the changes in the fair value of the \\r\\n\\r\\nhedged item attributable to the hedged risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nHedge ineffectiveness can theoretically arise from: \\r\\n\\r\\n A different interest rate curve applied to discount the hedged item and hedging instrument \\r\\n\\r\\n Differences in the timing of cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument, also a different day count \\r\\n\\r\\n The counterparties’ credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instrument and \\r\\n\\r\\nhedged item. \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2019 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 650 000 1 898 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial for the period 01 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 Notional amount Carrying Amount Line item in the statement of financial position \\r\\n\\r\\nInterest rate swap 350 000 1 128 Assets: Derivative financial instruments* \\r\\n\\r\\n* Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial during 2018.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrying amount of the major part of the Group’s assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of their fair \\r\\n\\r\\nvalue. Where the fair values of financial assets and liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position cannot be \\r\\n\\r\\nderived from active markets, they are determined in a way that unobservable inputs used to measure fair value would \\r\\n\\r\\nreflect the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing assets and liabilities, including assumptions \\r\\n\\r\\nabout the risk. Where observable market data is not available, expert judgment is required to establish fair values. For \\r\\n\\r\\nthe purposes of current financial statements, the above mentioned techniques related to unobservable inputs were \\r\\n\\r\\nnot used as no such financial assets and liabilities exist on the statement of financial position of the Group. \\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTIZED COST \\r\\n\\r\\nT EUR \\r\\nCarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value  \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2019 \\r\\n\\r\\nCarrying amount \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nFair value  \\r\\n\\r\\n31.12.2018 \\r\\n\\r\\nAssets     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial assets at amortized cost     \\r\\n\\r\\nCash and Balances with Central banks 2 924 019 2 924 019 3 293 090 3 293 090 \\r\\n\\r\\nDue from other credit institutions 141 645 141 645 185 346 185 346 \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLuminor Bank AS Interim report  \\r\\nfor the period ended 31 December 2019 \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n49  \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans to customers 10 222 547 11 431 020 11 472 138 11 484 286 \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial assets 13 288 211 14 496 684 14 950 574 14 962 722 \\r\\n\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\nLiabilities     \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost     \\r\\n\\r\\nLoans and deposits from credit institutions  980 692 980 692 3 939 396 3 906 454 \\r\\n\\r\\nDeposits from customers 10 235 443 10 235 443 9 069 885 9 098 414 \\r\\n\\r\\nDebt securities issued 651 716 653 967 351 235 353 233 \\r\\n\\r\\nLease liabilities 57 051 57 051 0 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nOther financial liabilities 45 303 45 303  27 914    27 914    \\r\\n\\r\\nTotal financial liabilities 11 970 205 11 972 456 13 388 430 13 386 015  \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next table below summarises the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities \\r\\n\\r\\naccounted for at fair value. Financial instruments are distributed by 3 levels of the fair value: \\r\\n\\r\\n Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access \\r\\n\\r\\nat the measurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and \\r\\n\\r\\nshall be used without adjustment to measure fair value whenever available. \\r\\n\\r\\n Level 2 — valuation techniques for which inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 are observable \\r\\n\\r\\nfor the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a \\r\\n\\r\\nLevel 2 input must be observable for a substantial part of the term of the asset or liability.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Level 3 — valuation techniques for which inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs \\r\\n\\r\\nshall be used to measure fair value to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing \\r\\n\\r\\nfor situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from \\r\\n\\r\\nthe perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Therefore, unobservable inputs \\r\\n\\r\\nshall reflect the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including \\r\\n\\r\\nassumptions about the risk.

value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be \\r\\n\\r\\nrealized at the same price in an orderly transaction.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Due from other credit institutions – The fair value equals to its carrying amount as the assets can be realized at \\r\\n\\r\\nthe same price in an orderly transaction. Due from other credit institutions are demand deposits. \\r\\n\\r\\n Loans to customers – Fair value has been estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows with the base curve \\r\\n\\r\\nused by the Bank (6m Euribor curve as average for all loans). \\r\\n\\r\\n Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (debt securities):  \\r\\n\\r\\n• For domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be \\r\\n\\r\\nthe priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading offers in the form of prices, yields \\r\\n\\r\\nor equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid prices shall be used \\r\\n\\r\\ntaking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there are no \\r\\n\\r\\nquotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers are \\r\\n\\r\\nclearly incorrect or artificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market data \\r\\n\\r\\nusing sources like Bloomberg or similar.  \\r\\n\\r\\n• The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using the \\r\\n\\r\\ninterest rates for items with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured using \\r\\n\\r\\nthe assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market \\r\\n\\r\\nparticipants act in their economic best interest. \\r\\n\\r\\n Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (equities, debt securities):  \\r\\n\\r\\n• The quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be the priority source for local equities. These are securities \\r\\n\\r\\nfor which active market exists based on the turnover, meaning availability of quotes at which market \\r\\n\\r\\nparticipants transact in the local stock market. The quotes of foreign equities shall be taken from Bloomberg \\r\\n\\r\\ngiving the priority to the primary market, and then to the country of issuer if the active market exists there. \\r\\n\\r\\nOtherwise, the market with the highest liquidity (turnover) shall be used as a source for pricing. If the quotes \\r\\n\\r\\nin primary data sources are clearly incorrect or artificial, the price of particular equity shall be derived from \\r\\n\\r\\nliquid market data using sources like Bloomberg or similar. Correctness of the quotes described above are \\r\\n\\r\\nthe subject of expert judgment of the Market and Liquidity Risk Management Department member together \\r\\n\\r\\nwith the Bank’s Markets Department’s dealer responsible for equity trading.

Alternatively, dividend discount model shall be used to determine \\r\\n\\r\\nthe price of equity. Expert opinion based on other available related market data shall be used for pricing of \\r\\n\\r\\nequity if the previously described methods are not possible. \\r\\n\\r\\n• For domestic debt instruments issued in the Baltic states, the quotes of local (Baltic) market makers shall be \\r\\n\\r\\nthe priority source. Local market makers (usually banks) publish the trading offers in the form of prices, \\r\\n\\r\\nyields or equivalent figures. If there are more than one market maker locally, the average of bid prices shall \\r\\n\\r\\nbe used taking the data from Bloomberg. If the debt instrument is issued outside the Baltic states, or there \\r\\n\\r\\nare no quotes available from local market makers on particular debt issue, or quotes of local market makers \\r\\n\\r\\nare clearly incorrect or artificial, the prices of particular debt securities shall be derived from liquid market \\r\\n\\r\\ndata using sources like Bloomberg or similar. \\r\\n\\r\\n• The fair value of interest-bearing financial instruments is estimated based on discounted cash flows using \\r\\n\\r\\nthe interest rates for items with similar terms and risk characteristics. The fair value of a liability is measured \\r\\n\\r\\nusing the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the liability, assuming that market \\r\\n\\r\\nparticipants act in their economic best interest. \\r\\n\\r\\n Derivative financial instruments – Market data from financial data vendors, electronic trading platforms or third-\\r\\n\\r\\nparty valuation are used for valuation purposes. The derivatives represent non-complex products valued with \\r\\n\\r\\ngenerally accepted models. Valuation inputs are derived from the market data. \\r\\n\\r\\n Loans and deposits from credit institutions – The fair value of loans equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the \\r\\n\\r\\nloans from credit institutions is under market conditions. Expected cash flows of the liabilities from the banks are \\r\\n\\r\\ndiscounted with the same market rates as loans. Loans from credit institutions are long-term. Deposits from credit \\r\\n\\r\\ninstitutions are demand deposits. The fair value of deposits equals to their carrying value. Pricing of the deposits \\r\\n\\r\\nfrom credit institutions is under market conditions.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Deposits from customers – The gross carrying amount of demand deposits as a fair value is applied as an \\r\\n\\r\\napproximation due to very short maturities. \\r\\n\\r\\n Debt securities issued – The debt securities issued by the Bank are initially recognized at fair value less transaction \\r\\n\\r\\ncosts and are subsequently carried at amortized cost using effective interest rate (EIR) method. The fair value is \\r\\n\\r\\ncalculated by discounting the future cash flows using the market interest rate yield curve. \\r\\n\\r\\n20.

SEGMENT REPORTING \\r\\n\\r\\nMEASUREMENT OF OPERATING SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE \\r\\n\\r\\nThe measurement principles and allocation between operating segments follow the information reported to the Chief \\r\\n\\r\\nOperating Decision Maker (CODM) as required by IFRS 8. In the Bank, the CODM has been defined as Management \\r\\n\\r\\nBoard. The Management Board monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of \\r\\n\\r\\nmaking decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based \\r\\n\\r\\non profit before tax and is measured consistently with profit before tax in the consolidated financial statements. Interest \\r\\n\\r\\nincome is reported net of expenses after internal funds transfer pricing, as management primarily relies on net interest \\r\\n\\r\\nrevenue across product categories as a performance measure. Fees and commission income for segment performance \\r\\n\\r\\nis also reported net of expenses and split is made between different product categories for segment reporting. \\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial results are presented for the three main operating segments: Corporate Banking, Retail Banking and Wealth \\r\\n\\r\\nManagement. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the \\r\\n\\r\\nCODM. Corporate Banking segment services business customers that have a dedicated relationship manager. Retail \\r\\n\\r\\nBanking segment services business customers without a dedicated relationship manager and private individuals not \\r\\n\\r\\nbelonging to Wealth Management segment. Wealth Management services wealthy private individuals and holding \\r\\n\\r\\ncompanies associated with those individuals. Results of other operating segments are included in Other segment. \\r\\n\\r\\nSegment results consist of income and expenses associated directly to the customers belonging under respective \\r\\n\\r\\nsegments (including internal funds transfer pricing result between operating segments and Unallocated segment) and \\r\\n\\r\\nincome and expenses not booked on customer level, which are allocated between the operating segments using \\r\\n\\r\\ninternally agreed allocation mechanisms. Only assets and liabilities relating to customers who belong to the operating \\r\\n\\r\\nsegments are reported under the respective segments, all other balance sheet items are reported under Other segment. \\r\\n\\r\\nStarting from 2019, new operating model got implemented in Luminor Group and CODM started monitoring operating \\r\\n\\r\\nsegments on the new basis (as described above). Restatement was made for historic periods for comparability. In June \\r\\n\\r\\n2019 it was decided to transfer customers with leasing exposures but without a relationship to bank entities from \\r\\n\\r\\nRetail segment to segment Other.  \\r\\n\\r\\n
