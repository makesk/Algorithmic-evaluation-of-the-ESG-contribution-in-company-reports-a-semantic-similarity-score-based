year most of our objectives were achieved with room to spare lhvs shares were listed on the tallinn stock exchange in may the overall staff satis faction is the highest on record and we received several important recognitions during the year the economic environment has remained stable despite the worrying underlying trends the inauguration of the new president of the united states is likely to add further to trade barriers to the detriment of most of the countrys trade partners including the european union against the backdrop of over regulation high debt burden negative demographic dynamics and radical tendencies in europe it is difficult to achieve long term broad based growth to fix these problems the governments of several major countries have decided to boost expenditure rather than maintain a budget balance with opec cutting production volumes this has fuelled expectations of inflation which can in itself be considered a positive trend in the current interest rate environment regional economic environment is characterised by a growth in wages and consumption in the baltic states a strong real estate cycle in sweden and a sluggish recovery in finnish economy investments are greatly missed in all of these markets despite a strong credit cycle growth in loan volumes is also evident in estonia although we can detect the first signs of a rise in credit pricing and growth in the number of companies in debt the greatest concern for enterprises is availability of labour and a quick growth in labour costs leading to a drop in profit nonetheless convergence with europe is unavoidable to enhance effi ciency of labour costs we therefore need to boost invest ments the record low fixed financing costs provide a good foundation for such efforts this is certainly something our enterprises should further exploit low interest rates have inflated the real estate sector trig gering a potential oversupply in rental cashflow projects lhv avoids

trend will be reversed with the global economic growth expected to gain momentum and reach this year the dynamics of the previous six months suggest that developed and developing markets have taken a different path the new administration in the united states foresees a growth in budgetary expenditure similarly the forecast for the chinese economy has been upwardly revised against endless

already revealing the first major changes in course growth in protec tionist tendencies review of international trade treaties and prolongation of the long awaited structural reforms have the potential to re shape the long term economic outlook economic growth in the euro area hovered around in with the annual change expected to remain in the same ballpark the imf forecasts a marginal slow down in growth to the return of inflation fuelled by the recovery in oil and energy prices will start exerting pressure on domestic consumption the main engine for growth so far with the pressure on wage increase remaining non existent consumption is positively affected by consistent growth in employment enhanced corporate profitability is bound to attract investments the economic sentiment indicator of estonias key trade partners remained at five year highs strongly advancing in the second half of the year a major advance in sentiment was evident in finland and lithuania in suggesting an improvement in the countries economic outlook despite overall optimism the economic growth in sweden is losing pace dropping to in this can mainly be attributed to stabilisation of domestic consumption which up to now has been stimulated by low interest rates the growth in investment volumes is also expected to slow down significantly the forecast for swedish economic growth this year is around estonias interests revolve around a strong growth in swedish import volumes and investor friendly tendencies in swedish banks finland is continuing its sluggish recovery with the economy growing in consumer confidence rose above long term average in and is nearing ten year highs the highest among eu member states the positive trend is reflected in the general economy where domestic consumption has remained the main engine for growth for quite some time the key for the upcoming year lies in the ability to boost export volumes so far this has remained quite a stumbling block similarly to sweden estonias inter ests lie in further growth in finnish import volumes the economic growth in lithuania a major destina tion market for lhv slowed down to in this can mainly be attributed to shrinking volumes of projects financed through eu assistance funds which also had an adverse effect on the construction sector strong domestic consumption remained the main engine for growth fuelled by a quick increase in wages and decrease in unemploy ment the lithuanian economic growth is expected to improve compared to the growth last year growth in the volume of eu financed projects could provide a further stimulus with the transition to the new programming period expected to contribute the estonian economy in can mainly be character ised by failure to meet the overly optimistic forecasts the estimated growth of is the slowest in the post crisis period difficulties in the oil shale industry and the energy sector mainly conditioned by external factors also had their bearing the poor investment volumes in recent years have impeded the potential growth of estonian economy the economic forecast published by the european central bank in december foresees a growth for

assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note the financial year started at january and ended at december the financial figures have been presented in thousands of euros unless referred differently in specific disclosures certain new ifrs standards amendments to existing stand ards and the interpretations of the standards have been published by the time of compiling these financial state ments which became mandatory for the groups reporting periods beginning on or after january the overview of these standards and the potential impact of applying the new standards and interpretations are stated below a adoption of new or revised standards and interpretations the following new or revised standards and interpretations became effective for the group from january annual improvements to ifrss effective in the eu for annual periods beginning on or after february the improvements consist of changes to seven standards ifrs was amended to clarify the definition of a vesting condition and to define separately performance condition and service condition the amendment is effective for share based payment transactions for which the grant date is on or after july ifrs was amended to require disclosure of the judge ments made by management in aggregating operating segments including a description of the segments which have been aggregated and the economic indicators which have been assessed in determining that the aggregated segments share similar economic characteristics and a reconciliation of segment assets to the entitys assets when segment assets are reported group uses segmentation in everyday management from year all the internal measurement including forecasting profitability measure ment and following key performance indicators is done based on segments the segmentation is done in principle that there is no double accounting of incomes costs sum of segments has to be equal to reporting entity results disclosure initiative amendments to ias effective in the eu for annual periods beginning on or after january the standard was amended to clarify the concept of materiality and explains that an entity need not provide a specific disclosure required by an ifrs if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material even if the ifrs contains a list of specific requirements or describes them as minimum requirements the standard also provides new guidance on subtotals in financial statements in particular such subtotals a should be comprised of line items made up of amounts recognised and measured in accordance with ifrs b be presented and labelled in a manner that makes the line items that constitute the subtotal clear and understandable c be consistent from period to period and d not be displayed with more prominence than the subto tals and totals required by ifrs standards there are no other new or revised standards or interpreta tions that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after january that have a material impact on the group b new accounting pronouncements certain new or revised standards and interpretations have been issued that are mandatory for the groups annual periods beginning on or after january and which the group has not early adopted ifrs financial instruments effective for annual periods beginning on or after january the standard is endorsed by the eu commission earlier application is permitted but the group does not intend to early adopt the note summary of significant accounting policies new stamp as lhv group tartu mnt tallinn info lhv ee lhv ee standard the group intends to use relief of not restating comparative figures for in the annual report when first adopting ifrs key features of the new standard are as follows financial assets are required to be classified into three measurement categories assets to be measured subsequently at amortised cost assets to be measured subsequently at fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci assets to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss fvpl the classification and measurement requirements in ifrs state that financial assets should be classified as and meas ured at amortized cost fair value through profit and loss or fair value through other comprehensive income the classifi cation of a financial instrument is dependent on the business model for the portfolio where the instrument is included and on whether the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest in order to assess the business model the group has divided its financial assets into portfolios and or sub portfolios based on how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective classification for debt instruments is driven by the entitys business model for managing the financial assets and whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest sppi if a debt instru ment is held to collect it may be carried at amortised cost if it also meets the sppi requirement debt instruments that meet the sppi requirement that are held in a portfolio where an entity both holds to collect assets cash flows and sells assets may be classified as fvoci financial assets that do not contain cash flows that are sppi must be measured at fvpl for example derivatives embedded derivatives are no longer separated from financial assets but will be included in assessing the sppi condition investments in equity instruments are always measured at fair value however management can make an irrevocable election to present changes in fair value in other comprehen sive income provided the instrument is not held for trading if the equity instrument is held for trading changes in fair value are presented in profit or loss most of the requirements in ias for classification and measurement of financial liabilities were carried forward unchanged to ifrs the key change is that an entity will be required to present the effects of changes in own credit risk of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss in other comprehensive income the analysis of the business model described above is still ongoing current results have not indicated signifi cant changes compared to how the financial instruments are measured under ias no significant impact is thus expected on the groups financial position financial perfor mance or equity in the period of initial application these conclusions are tentative and may be affected by the actual financial positions at the transition the impairment requirements in ifrs are based on an expected credit loss ecl model as opposed to the current incurred loss model in ias the scope of ifrs impair ment requirements is also broader than ias ifrs requires all assets measured at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income as well as off balance commitments including guarantees and loan commitments to be included in the impairment test the assets to test for impairment will be divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration stage includes assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk stage includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage includes defaulted assets significant assets in stage are tested for impairment on an individual basis while for insignificant assets a collective assessment is performed in stage the provisions should equal the month ecl in stage and the provisions should equal the lifetime ecl one important driver for size of provisions under ifrs is the trigger for transforming an asset from stage to stage the group is in process of deciding what parameters to use for identifying the increase in credit risk and how much these parameters need to change in order to constitute a significant increase the analyses and decisions should be finalized latest in june for assets to be recognized going forward changes to the lifetime probability of default pd will be used as the trigger in addition customers with forbearance measures and customers with payments more than thirty days past due will also be transferred to stage the group s current model for calculating collective provi sions defines a loss event as a deterioration in rating scoring but it is not expected that the loss event in the current model will equal the triggering event for moving items from stage to stage under ifrs the provisions under ifrs will be calculated as the exposure at default times the probability of default times the loss given default for assets in stage this calculation will only be based on the coming months while it for assets in stage will be based on the expected lifetime of the asset for assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk the group currently holds provisions based on the losses estimated to occur during the period between the date when the loss event occurred and the date when new stamp as lhv group tartu mnt tallinn info lhv ee lhv ee the loss event is identified on an individual basis while ifrs will require provisions equal to the lifetime expected loss when calculating lifetime losses under ifrs including the staging assessment the calculation should be based on probability weighted forward looking information it is expected the newer requirements will increase the volatility in loan loss provisions and have negative effect in equity in the period of initial application it is not expected to have any material impact on large exposures the impact on capital adequacy is not possible to determine as it is expected the basel committee will issue new rules for the transiton to ifrs but these are not yet final it is furthermore expected that the long term effects once the transitional rules become obsolete will be negative on capital adequacy as the reduc tion in equity is expected to reduce cet capital impairment calculations under ifrs will require more experienced credit judgement by the reporting entities than required by ias today and a higher subjectivity is thus introduced the inclusion of forward looking information adds complexity and makes provisions more dependent on management s view of the future economic outlook it is expected that the impairment calculations under ifrs will be more volatile and pro cyclical than under ias mainly due to the significant subjectivity applied in the forward looking scenarios the main change to the general hedge accounting require ments is that the standard aligns hedge accounting more closely with the risk management activities these changes will not have direct effect on the group as the group is currently not using hedge accounting same time we see that the regulation changes will generate some new possi bilities to the group to start using hedge accounting for reducing volatility in financial statements for positions which are hedged with ones treated differently in accounting group has set up a project developing the needed changes both in risk management and in it systems the final outcome of the impact of the new standard on its finan cial statements is not clear yet and will be clear in second quarter still group is clear that there will be added new volatility to provisioning the provisions models will be more complex and visibility will somewhat lower we have calculated the impact to the cost of development and its around thousand ifrs leases effective for annual periods beginning on or after january not yet adopted by the eu the new standard sets out the principles for the recognition meas urement presentation and disclosure of leases all leases result in the lessee obtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and if lease payments are made over time also obtaining financing accordingly ifrs eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases as is required by ias and instead introduces a single lessee accounting model lessees will be required to recognise a assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than months unless the underlying asset is of low value and b depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the income statement ifrs substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in ias accordingly a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases and to account for those two types of leases differently the group is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its financial statements disclosure initiative amendments to ias effective for annual periods beginning on or after january not yet adopted by the eu the amended ias will require disclo sure of a reconciliation of movements in liabilities arising from financing activities the group is currently assessing the impact of the amendment on its financial statements ifrs revenue from contracts with customers effec tive for annual periods beginning on or after january the new standard introduces the core principle that revenue must be recognised when the goods or services are transferred to the customer at the transaction price any bundled goods or services that are distinct must be separately recognised and any discounts or rebates on the contract price must generally be allocated to the separate elements when the consideration varies for any reason minimum amounts must be recognised if they are not at significant risk of reversal costs incurred to secure contracts with customers have to be capitalised and amor tised over the period when the benefits of the contract are consumed the largest impact will be positive to the as lhv varahaldus where we need to capitalize sales costs from previous years and amortize over the lifetime of the customer which in pension fund case is above years this effect will significantly increase lhv varahaldus own funds at the moment of adoption of this ifrs standard the group is currently assessing the exact impact of the new standard on its financial statements revenue from contracts with customers amendments to ifrs effective for annual periods beginning on or after january not yet adopted by the eu the amendments do not change the underlying principles of

two additional reliefs to reduce cost and complexity for a company when it first applies the new standard the group is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its financial statements

credit risk for the purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment financial assets are grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics those characteristics are relevant to the estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets by being indicative of the debtors ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated future cash flows in a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis of the contractual cash flows of the assets and the experience of management in respect of the extent to which amounts will become overdue as a result of past loss events and the success of recovery of overdue amounts past experience is adjusted on the basis of current observ able data to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect past periods and to remove the effects of past conditions that do not exist currently the group regularly reviews future cash flow assessment methods and assump tions in order to reduce potential differences between loss estimates and actual losses if the terms of an impaired financial asset held at amor tised cost are renegotiated or otherwise modified because of financial difficulties of the borrower or issuer impair ment is measured using the original effective interest rate before the modification of terms the renegotiated asset is then derecognized and a new asset is recognized at its fair value only if the risks and rewards of the asset substantially changed this is normally evidenced by a substantial differ ence between the present values of the original cash flows and the new expected cash flows impairment losses are always recognised through an allow ance account to write down the assets carrying amount to the present value of expected cash flows which exclude future credit losses that have not been incurred discounted at the original effective interest rate of the asset the calcu

the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised such as an improvement in the debtors credit rating the previ ously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account through profit or loss for the year the reversal of the impairment loss is recognised as income in the line impairment losses on loans and advances in the statement of profit or loss uncollectible assets are written off against the related impairment loss provision after all the necessary procedures to recover the asset have

ethical requirements of the auditors activities act of the republic of estonia we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the iesba code and the ethical requirements of the auditors activities act of the republic of estonia our audit approach overview materiality overall group materiality is eur thousand which represents of profit before tax adjusted for any significant one off gains or losses audit scope a full scope audit was performed by pwc network firms for group entities covering substantially all of the groups consolidated statements of financial position and profit or loss key audit matters impairment of loans and advances to customers accounting for the acquisition of danske capital as as part of designing our audit we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements in particular we considered where the management board made subjective judgments for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain as in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud materiality the scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality an audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement misstatements may arise due to fraud or error they are considered material if individually or in aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements based on our professional judgment we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below these together with qualitative considerations helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole overall group materiality eur thousand how we determined it of profit before tax adjusted for any significant one off gains or losses rationale for the materiality benchmark applied the use of profit before tax is considered appropriate as in our view profit before tax is stakeholders primary measurement benchmark and key performance indicator for management and supervisory board the adjusting items are excluded on the basis that they do not reflect the day to day operational performance of the group materiality audit scope key audit matters we agreed with the audit committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above eur thousand as well as misstatements below that amount that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons key audit matters key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters key audit matter how our audit addressed the key audit matter impairment of loans and advances to customers refer to note summary of significant accounting policies note credit risk and note loans and advances to customers for further details as at december loans and advances to customers amounted to eur million and related impairment loss for amounted to eur million we focused on this area because management makes complex and subjective judgments over both timing of recognition of impairment and the estimation of the size of any such impairment for corporate loans a portion of impairment is individually assessed by taking into consideration the credit rating of the customer and other known heightened risk factors credit rating is assigned considering a combination of financial and business risks associated with the customer individual impairment is calculated based on the exposure and realisable value of the collateral at the balance sheet date in addition to individual assessment and impairment calculation of corporate loans a significant portion of their impairment is calculated on a collective basis taking into account customer rating historical performance the probability of default loss given default and other factors loans to individuals and loans to legal entities other than corporate loans are grouped for impairment calculation purposes into sub classes on the basis of we assessed whether the groups accounting policies in relation to the impairment of loans and advances to customers are in compliance with ifrs we assessed the design and operating effectiveness of the controls over impairment data and calculations these controls included those over the identification of which loans and advances were individually impaired overdue loans monitoring and the calculation of the collective impairment provisions including annual validation process of collective impairment model inputs in addition we tested the design and operating effectiveness of the credit file periodic review and rating assessment and monitoring of collateral controls for corporate loans we determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit we performed detailed testing over the completeness and accuracy of data in the impairment model for collective impairment calculations the internal assignment of credit ratings for corporate loan customers the assumptions used for critical inputs in the collective impairment model such as probability of default and loss given default we have checked the annual calculations of probability of default and loss given default performed by management for material loan products by evaluating the correctness of the calculation methodology and historical data used the correctness of information on collaterals homogeneous credit risk features the major part of impairment for those sub classes is calculated on a collective basis taking into account historical performance the probability of default loss given default and other factors areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates are the identification and monitoring process of corporate customers with ratings below investment grade and other known heightened risk factors and individual impairment calculations of such loans with special attention on the valuation of collaterals the key assumptions and judgments made by management that underlie the calculation of collective impairment key assumptions and judgments include the probability of default calculation the loss given default calculation and credit conversion factor calculation the assessment of annual internal validation process of group based valuation models taking into account the repayment behavior of different customer groups and the completeness of the customer accounts that are included in the impairment calculation and their values in the loan systems and the completeness of loans subject to individual impairment assessment and related calculations for customers operating in currently low performing industry sectors e g agriculture and oil industry we checked the total exposure of customer loans in those sectors and assessed the performance of those customers based on internal and external information in the case of some impairment provisions we formed a different view from that of the management but in our view the differences were within a reasonable range of outcomes in the context of the overall loans and advances and the uncertainties disclosed in the financial statements as a result of our work we noted no material exceptions accounting for the acquisition of danske capital as refer to note summary of significant accounting policies and note subsidiaries and associated companies goodwill for further details in may the group acquired the asset management company danske capital as together with pension and investment funds managed by it for a total consideration of eur million as further described in note accounting for business combination involves compiling the purchase price allocation during which the fair value of the purchase consideration paid is allocated to the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed with any remaining difference recorded as goodwill these fair values were assessed by the management and it required judgment due to the size of the acquired business and related estimation uncertainty it is considered a key audit matter we assessed whether the groups accounting policy in relation to accounting for the business combinations is in compliance with ifrs we evaluated and performed detailed testing of the purchase price allocation compiled by the management including assessing the list of separately identified assets and liabilities for their reasonableness and compliance with ifrs requirements evaluating the managements assessment of the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed involving pwc valuation experts to evaluate the methodology applied for determination of fair values deploying our pwc valuation experts we tested the reasonableness of key assumptions including cash flow forecasts customer churn rate and discount rates and checking the correctness of calculation of arising goodwill furthermore we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the acquisition of danske capital as as a result of our work we noted no material exceptions how we tailored our audit scope we tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole taking into

to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements as part of an audit in accordance with isas we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit we also identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether due to fraud or error design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the override of internal control obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the groups internal control evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management board conclude on the appropriateness of the management boards use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the groups ability to continue as a going concern if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists we are required to draw attention in our auditors report to the

thought to bear on our independence and where applicable related safeguards from the matters communicated with those charged with governance we determine those matters that were of most significance

year most of our objectives were achieved with room to spare lhvs shares were listed on the tallinn stock exchange in may the overall staff satis faction is the highest on record and we received several important recognitions during the year the economic environment has remained stable despite the worrying underlying trends the inauguration of the new president of the united states is likely to add further to trade barriers to the detriment of most of the countrys trade partners including the european union against the backdrop of over regulation high debt burden negative demographic dynamics and radical tendencies in europe it is difficult to achieve long term broad based growth to fix these problems the governments of several major countries have decided to boost expenditure rather than maintain a budget balance with opec cutting production volumes this has fuelled expectations of inflation which can in itself be considered a positive trend in the current interest rate environment regional economic environment is characterised by a growth in wages and consumption in the baltic states a strong real estate cycle in sweden and a sluggish recovery in finnish economy investments are greatly missed in all of these markets despite a strong credit cycle growth in loan volumes is also evident in estonia although we can detect the first signs of a rise in credit pricing and growth in the number of companies in debt the greatest concern for enterprises is availability of labour and a quick growth in labour costs leading to a drop in profit nonetheless convergence with europe is unavoidable to enhance effi ciency of labour costs we therefore need to boost invest ments the record low fixed financing costs provide a good foundation for such efforts this is certainly something our enterprises should further exploit low interest rates have inflated the real estate sector trig gering a potential oversupply in rental cashflow projects lhv avoids

even though the final figures are yet to be revealed the world economy is likely to have decelerated in for the second year in a row according to imfs january forecast there is a good chance that the trend will be reversed with the global economic growth expected to gain momentum and reach this year the dynamics of the previous six months suggest that developed and developing markets have taken a different path the new administration in the united states foresees a growth in budgetary expenditure similarly the forecast for the chinese economy has been upwardly revised against endless government stimulus in latin america however economic recovery has remained sluggish failing all expec tations mexico is suffering from us related political uncer tainty and the indian economy from

already revealing the first major changes in course growth in protec tionist tendencies review of international trade treaties and prolongation of the long awaited structural reforms have the potential to re shape the long term economic outlook economic growth in the euro area hovered around in with the annual change expected to remain in the same ballpark the imf forecasts a marginal slow down in growth to the return of inflation fuelled by the recovery in oil and energy prices will start exerting pressure on domestic consumption the main engine for growth so far with the pressure on wage increase remaining non existent consumption is positively affected by consistent growth in employment enhanced corporate profitability is bound to attract investments the economic sentiment indicator of estonias key trade partners remained at five year highs strongly advancing in the second half of the year a major advance in sentiment was evident in finland and lithuania in suggesting an improvement in the countries economic outlook despite overall optimism the economic growth in sweden is losing pace dropping to in this can mainly be attributed to stabilisation of domestic consumption which up to now has been stimulated by low interest rates the growth in investment volumes is also expected to slow down significantly the forecast for swedish economic growth this year is around estonias interests revolve around a strong growth in swedish import volumes and investor friendly tendencies in swedish banks finland is continuing its sluggish recovery with the economy growing in consumer confidence rose above long term average in and is nearing ten year highs the highest among eu member states the positive trend is reflected in the general economy where domestic consumption has remained the main engine for growth for quite some time the key for the upcoming year lies in the ability to boost export volumes so far this has remained quite a stumbling block similarly to sweden estonias inter ests lie in further growth in finnish import volumes the economic growth in lithuania a major destina tion market for lhv slowed down to in this can mainly be attributed to shrinking volumes of projects financed through eu assistance funds which also had an adverse effect on the construction sector strong domestic consumption remained the main engine for growth fuelled by a quick increase in wages and decrease in unemploy ment the lithuanian economic growth is expected to improve compared to the growth last year growth in the volume of eu financed projects could provide a further stimulus with the transition to the new programming period expected to contribute the estonian economy in can mainly be character ised by failure to meet the overly optimistic forecasts the estimated growth of is the slowest in the post crisis period difficulties in the oil shale industry and the energy sector mainly conditioned by external factors also had their bearing the poor investment volumes in recent years have impeded the potential growth of estonian economy the economic forecast published by the european central bank in december foresees a growth for the year income increase is expected to continue but the return of inflation will have a significant impact on growth in real wages conse quently export and investments are becoming increasingly

the definition of a vesting condition and to define separately performance condition and service condition the amendment is effective for share based payment transactions for which the grant date is on or after july ifrs was amended to require disclosure of the judge ments made by management in aggregating operating segments including a description of the segments which have been aggregated and the economic indicators which have been assessed in determining that the aggregated segments share similar economic characteristics and a reconciliation of segment assets to the entitys assets when segment assets are reported group uses segmentation in everyday management from year all the internal measurement including forecasting profitability measure ment and following key performance indicators is done based on segments the segmentation is done in principle that there is no double accounting of incomes costs sum of segments has to be equal to reporting entity results disclosure initiative amendments to ias effective in the eu for annual periods beginning on or after january the standard was amended to clarify the concept of materiality and explains that an entity need not provide a specific disclosure required by an ifrs if the information resulting from that disclosure is not material even if the ifrs contains a list of specific requirements or describes them as minimum requirements the standard also provides new guidance on subtotals in financial statements in particular such subtotals a should be comprised of line items made up of amounts recognised and measured in accordance with ifrs b be presented and labelled in a manner that makes the line items that constitute the subtotal clear and understandable c be consistent from period to period and d not be displayed with more prominence than the subto tals and totals required by ifrs standards there are no other new or revised standards or interpreta tions that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after january that have a material impact on the group b new accounting pronouncements certain new or revised standards and interpretations have been issued that are mandatory for the groups annual periods beginning on or after january and which the group has not early adopted ifrs financial instruments effective for annual periods beginning on or after january the standard is endorsed by the eu commission earlier application is permitted but the group does not intend to early adopt the note summary of significant accounting policies new stamp as lhv group tartu mnt tallinn info lhv ee lhv ee standard the group intends to use relief of not restating comparative figures for in the annual report when first adopting ifrs key features of the new standard are as follows financial assets are required to be classified into three measurement categories assets to be measured subsequently at amortised cost assets to be measured subsequently at fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci assets to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss fvpl the classification and measurement requirements in ifrs state that financial assets should be classified as and meas ured at amortized cost fair value through profit and loss or fair value through other comprehensive income the classifi cation of a financial instrument is dependent on the business model for the portfolio where the instrument is included and on whether the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest in order to assess the business model the group has divided its financial assets into portfolios and or sub portfolios based on how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective classification for debt instruments is driven by the entitys business model for managing the financial assets and whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest sppi if a debt instru ment is held to collect it may be carried at amortised cost if it also meets the sppi requirement debt instruments that meet the sppi requirement that are held in a portfolio where an entity both holds to collect assets cash flows and sells assets may be classified as fvoci financial assets that do not contain cash flows that are sppi must be measured at fvpl for example derivatives embedded derivatives are no longer separated from financial assets but will be included in assessing the sppi condition investments in equity instruments are always measured at fair value however management can make an irrevocable election to present changes in fair value in other comprehen sive income provided the instrument is not held for trading if the equity instrument is held for trading changes in fair value are presented in profit or loss most of the requirements in ias for classification and measurement of financial liabilities were carried forward unchanged to ifrs the key change is that an entity will be required to present the effects of changes in own credit risk of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss in other comprehensive income the analysis of the business model described above is still ongoing current results have not indicated signifi cant changes compared to how the financial instruments are measured under ias no significant impact is thus expected on the groups financial position financial perfor mance or equity in the period of initial application these conclusions are tentative and may be affected by the actual financial positions at the transition the impairment requirements in ifrs are based on an expected credit loss ecl model as opposed to the current incurred loss model in ias the scope of ifrs impair ment requirements is also broader than ias ifrs requires all assets measured at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income as well as off balance commitments including guarantees and loan commitments to be included in the impairment test the assets to test for impairment will be divided into three groups depending on the stage of credit deterioration stage includes assets where there has been no significant increase in credit risk stage includes assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk and stage includes defaulted assets significant assets in stage are tested for impairment on an individual basis while for insignificant assets a collective assessment is performed in stage the provisions should equal the month ecl in stage and the provisions should equal the lifetime ecl one important driver for size of provisions under ifrs is the trigger for transforming an asset from stage to stage the group is in process of deciding what parameters to use for identifying the increase in credit risk and how much these parameters need to change in order to constitute a significant increase the analyses and decisions should be finalized latest in june for assets to be recognized going forward changes to the lifetime probability of default pd will be used as the trigger in addition customers with forbearance measures and customers with payments more than thirty days past due will also be transferred to stage the group s current model for calculating collective provi sions defines a loss event as a deterioration in rating scoring but it is not expected that the loss event in the current model will equal the triggering event for moving items from stage to stage under ifrs the provisions under ifrs will be calculated as the exposure at default times the probability of default times the loss given default for assets in stage this calculation will only be based on the coming months while it for assets in stage will be based on the expected lifetime of the asset for assets where there has been a significant increase in credit risk the group currently holds provisions based on the losses estimated to occur during the period between the date when the loss event occurred and the date when new stamp as lhv group tartu mnt tallinn info lhv ee lhv ee the loss event is identified on an individual basis while ifrs will require provisions equal to the lifetime expected loss when calculating lifetime losses under ifrs including the staging assessment the calculation should be based on probability weighted forward looking information it is expected the newer requirements will increase the volatility in loan loss provisions and have negative effect in equity in the period of initial application it is not expected to have any material impact on large exposures the impact on capital adequacy is not possible to determine as it is expected the basel committee will issue new rules for the transiton to ifrs but these are not yet final it is furthermore expected that the long term effects once the transitional rules become obsolete will be negative on capital adequacy as the reduc tion in equity is expected to reduce cet capital impairment calculations under ifrs will require more experienced credit judgement by the reporting entities than required by ias today and a higher subjectivity is thus introduced the inclusion of forward looking information adds complexity and makes provisions more dependent on management s view of the future economic outlook it is expected that the impairment calculations under ifrs will be more volatile and pro cyclical than under ias mainly due to the significant subjectivity applied in the forward looking scenarios the main change to the general hedge accounting require ments is that the standard aligns hedge accounting more closely with the risk management activities these changes will not have direct effect on the group as the group is currently not using hedge accounting same time we see that the regulation changes will generate some new possi bilities to the group to start using hedge accounting for reducing volatility in financial statements for positions which are hedged with ones treated differently in accounting group has set up a project developing the needed changes both in risk management and in it systems the final outcome of the impact of the new standard on its finan cial statements is not clear yet and will be clear in second quarter still group is clear that there will be added new volatility to provisioning the provisions models will be more complex and visibility will somewhat lower we have calculated the impact to the cost of development and its around thousand ifrs leases effective for annual periods beginning on or after january not yet adopted by the eu the new standard sets out the principles for the recognition meas urement presentation and disclosure of leases all leases result in the lessee obtaining the right to use an asset at the start of the lease and if lease payments are made over time also obtaining financing accordingly ifrs eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases as is required by ias and instead introduces a single lessee accounting model lessees will be required to recognise a assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than months unless the underlying asset is of low value and b depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the income statement ifrs substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in ias accordingly a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases and to account for those two types of leases differently the group is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its financial statements disclosure initiative amendments to ias effective for annual periods beginning on or after january not yet adopted by the eu the amended ias will require disclo sure of a reconciliation of movements in liabilities arising from financing activities the group is currently assessing the impact of the amendment on its financial statements ifrs revenue from contracts with customers effec tive for annual periods beginning on or after january the new standard introduces the core principle that revenue must be recognised when the goods or services are transferred to the customer at the transaction price any bundled goods or services that are distinct must be separately recognised and any discounts or rebates on the contract price must generally be allocated to the separate elements when the consideration varies for any reason minimum amounts must be recognised if they are not at significant risk of reversal costs incurred to secure contracts with customers have to be capitalised and amor tised over the period when the benefits of the contract are consumed the largest impact will be positive to the as lhv varahaldus where we need to capitalize sales costs from previous years and amortize over the lifetime of the customer which in pension fund case is above years this effect will significantly increase lhv varahaldus own funds at the moment of adoption of this ifrs standard the group is currently assessing the exact impact of the new standard on its financial statements revenue from contracts with customers amendments to ifrs effective for annual periods beginning on or after january not yet adopted by the eu the amendments do not change the underlying principles of the standard but clarify how those principles should be applied the amendments clarify how to identify a performance obligation the promise to transfer a good or new stamp as lhv group tartu mnt tallinn info lhv ee lhv ee a service to a customer in a contract how to determine whether a company is a principal the provider of a good or service or an agent responsible for arranging for the good or service to be provided and how to determine whether the revenue from granting a licence should be recognised at a point in time or over time in addition to the clarifications the amendments include two additional reliefs to reduce cost and complexity for a company when it first applies the new standard the group is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on its financial statements

to reflect the effects of current conditions that did not affect past periods and to remove the effects of past conditions that do not exist currently the group regularly reviews future cash flow

statement of financial position fair value interest rate risk whereby in case of a change in market interest rates a change in the groups economic value is limited fair value of assets and liabilities

value is positive due to the fact that the bank has majorly invested in current assets and because of the prolonged nature of demand deposits hence the average duration of assets exposures to interest

risk of the group according to the recalculation dates of interest rates at the principal amounts of receivables and liabilities leveraged loans are treated as a one month product maturing at the next interest fixing date demand deposits are divided as follows liquidity accounts with the duration of months and other demand deposits with the duration of years based on their behav ioural nature the interest rate of demand deposits is not sensitive to market rate fluctuations the prices of derivative contracts on the market are the bases for the assumption that the interest rates of the time

information basis for opinion we conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing isas our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditors responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion independence we are independent of the group in accordance with the international ethics standards board for accountants code of ethics for professional accountants iesba code and the ethical requirements of the auditors activities act of the republic of estonia we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the iesba code and the ethical requirements of the auditors activities act of the republic of estonia our audit approach overview materiality overall group materiality is eur thousand which represents of profit before tax adjusted for any significant one off gains or losses audit scope a full scope audit was performed by pwc network firms for group entities covering substantially all of the groups consolidated statements of financial position and profit or loss key audit matters impairment of loans and advances to customers accounting for the acquisition of danske capital as as part of designing our audit we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements in particular we considered where the management board made subjective judgments for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain as in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud materiality the scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality an audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement misstatements may arise due to fraud or error they are considered material if individually or in aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements based on our professional judgment we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below these together with qualitative considerations helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole overall group materiality eur thousand how we determined it of profit before tax adjusted for any significant one off gains or losses rationale for the materiality benchmark applied the use of profit before tax is considered appropriate as in our view profit before tax is stakeholders primary measurement benchmark and key performance indicator for management and supervisory board the adjusting items are excluded on the basis that they do not reflect the day to day operational performance of the group materiality audit scope key audit matters we agreed with the audit committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above eur thousand as well as misstatements below that amount that in our view warranted reporting for qualitative reasons key audit matters key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters key audit matter how our audit addressed the key audit matter impairment of loans and advances to customers refer to note summary of significant accounting policies note credit risk and note loans and advances to customers for further details as at december loans and advances to customers amounted to eur million and related impairment loss for amounted to eur million we focused on this area because management makes complex and subjective judgments over both timing of recognition of impairment and the estimation of the size of any such impairment for corporate loans a portion of impairment is individually assessed by taking into consideration the credit rating of the customer and other known heightened risk factors credit rating is assigned considering a combination of financial and business risks associated with the customer individual impairment is calculated based on the exposure and realisable value of the collateral at the balance sheet date in addition to individual assessment and impairment calculation of corporate loans a significant portion of their impairment is calculated on a collective basis taking into account customer rating historical performance the probability of default loss given default and other factors loans to individuals and loans to legal entities other than corporate loans are grouped for impairment calculation purposes into sub classes on the basis of we assessed whether the groups accounting policies in relation to the impairment of loans and advances to customers are in compliance with ifrs we assessed the design and operating effectiveness of the controls over impairment data and calculations these controls included those over the identification of which loans and advances were individually impaired overdue loans monitoring and the calculation of the collective impairment provisions including annual validation process of collective impairment model inputs in addition we tested the design and operating effectiveness of the credit file periodic review and rating assessment and monitoring of collateral controls for corporate loans we determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit we performed detailed testing over the completeness and accuracy of data in the impairment model for collective impairment calculations the internal assignment of credit ratings for corporate loan customers the assumptions used for critical inputs in the collective impairment model such as probability of default and loss given default we have checked the annual calculations of probability of default and loss given default performed by management for material loan products by evaluating the correctness of the calculation methodology and historical data used the correctness of information on collaterals homogeneous credit risk features the major part of impairment for those sub classes is calculated on a collective basis taking into account historical performance the probability of default loss given default and other factors areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates are the identification and monitoring process of corporate customers with ratings below investment grade and other known heightened risk factors and individual impairment calculations of such loans with special attention on the valuation of collaterals the key assumptions and judgments made by management that underlie the calculation of collective impairment key assumptions and judgments include the probability of default calculation the loss given default calculation and credit conversion factor calculation the assessment of annual internal validation process of group based valuation models taking into account the repayment behavior of different customer groups and the completeness of the customer accounts that are included in the impairment calculation and their values in the loan systems and the completeness of loans subject to individual impairment assessment and related calculations for customers operating in currently low performing industry sectors e g agriculture and oil industry we checked the total exposure of customer loans in those sectors and assessed the performance of those customers based on internal and external information in the case of some impairment provisions we formed a different view from that of the management but in our view the differences were within a reasonable range of outcomes in the context of the overall loans and advances and the uncertainties disclosed in the financial statements as a result of our work we noted no material exceptions accounting for the acquisition of danske capital as refer to note summary of significant accounting policies and note subsidiaries and associated companies goodwill for further details in may the group acquired the asset management company danske capital as together with pension and investment funds managed by it for a total consideration of eur million as further described in note accounting for business combination involves compiling the purchase price allocation during which the fair value of the purchase consideration paid is allocated to the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed with any remaining difference recorded as goodwill these fair values were assessed by the management and it required judgment due to the size of the acquired business and related estimation uncertainty it is considered a key audit matter we assessed whether the groups accounting policy in relation to accounting for the business combinations is in compliance with ifrs we evaluated and performed detailed testing of the purchase price allocation compiled by the management including assessing the list of separately identified assets and liabilities for their reasonableness and compliance with ifrs requirements evaluating the managements assessment of the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed involving pwc valuation experts to evaluate the methodology applied for determination of fair values deploying our pwc valuation experts we tested the reasonableness of key assumptions including cash flow forecasts customer churn rate and discount rates and checking the correctness of calculation of arising goodwill furthermore we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the acquisition of danske capital as as a result of our work we noted no material exceptions how we tailored our audit scope we tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole taking into account the structure of the group the accounting processes and controls and the financial services industry in which the group operates the group comprises a number of subsidiaries that mostly operate in estonia and lithuania refer to note a full scope audit was performed by pwc estonia or other pwc network firms for the following group entities covering substantially all of the groups consolidated statements of financial position and profit or loss lhv group as lhv pank as including its subsidiary lhv finance as lhv varahaldus as and uab mokilizingas where the work was performed by

the group financial statements as a whole the nature timing and extent of the work performed by other pwc network firms impacting the group audit opinion is set and monitored in estonia other information the management board is responsible for the other information contained in the consolidated annual report in addition to the consolidated financial statements and our auditors report thereon our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon in connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated if based on the work we have performed we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact we have nothing to report in this regard responsibilities of the management board and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements the management board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the european union and for such internal control as the management board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error in preparing the consolidated financial statements the management board is responsible for assessing the groups ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management board either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the groups financial reporting process auditors responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with isas will always detect a material misstatement when it exists misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements as part of an audit in accordance with isas we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit we also identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements whether due to fraud or error design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error as fraud may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the override of internal control obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the groups internal control evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management board conclude on the appropriateness of the management boards use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the groups ability to continue as a going concern if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists we are required to draw attention in our auditors report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate to modify our opinion our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors report however future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern evaluate the overall presentation structure and content of the consolidated financial statements including the disclosures and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements we are responsible for the direction supervision and performance of the group audit we remain solely responsible for our audit opinion we communicate with those charged with governance regarding among other matters the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit we also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable related safeguards from the matters communicated with those charged with governance we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters we describe these matters in our auditors report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when in extremely rare circumstances we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would
